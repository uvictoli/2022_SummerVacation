       "'THE BROTHERS GRIMM FAIRY TALES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLDEN BIRD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree\\r\\nwhich bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about\\r\\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\\r\\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\\r\\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\\r\\neldest son to watch; but about twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock he fell asleep, and in\\r\\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\\r\\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\\r\\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\\r\\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\\r\\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\\r\\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\\r\\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\\r\\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s son\\r\\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\\r\\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\\r\\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\\r\\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\\r\\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, â\\x80\\x98One feather is of no\\r\\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\\r\\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\\r\\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\\r\\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, â\\x80\\x98Do not shoot me,\\r\\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\\r\\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\\r\\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\\r\\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\\r\\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\\r\\nto be very poor and mean.â\\x80\\x99 But the son thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98What can\\r\\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?â\\x80\\x99 So he shot his arrow at\\r\\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\\r\\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\\r\\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\\r\\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\\r\\nand poor. â\\x80\\x98I should be very silly,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98if I went to that shabby\\r\\nhouse, and left this charming placeâ\\x80\\x99; so he went into the smart house,\\r\\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\\r\\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\\r\\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\\r\\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\\r\\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\\r\\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\\r\\nhis country in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\\r\\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\\r\\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\\r\\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\\r\\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\\r\\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\\r\\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\\r\\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, â\\x80\\x98Sit upon my\\r\\ntail, and you will travel faster.â\\x80\\x99 So he sat down, and the fox began to\\r\\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\\r\\nwhistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the foxâ\\x80\\x99s counsel, and\\r\\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\\r\\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\\r\\nwas beginning his journey, and said, â\\x80\\x98Go straight forward, till you come\\r\\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\\r\\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\\r\\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\\r\\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\\r\\nyou will repent it.â\\x80\\x99 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\\r\\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\\r\\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\\r\\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\\r\\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\\r\\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, â\\x80\\x98It will be a\\r\\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cageâ\\x80\\x99; so\\r\\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\\r\\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\\r\\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\\r\\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\\r\\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\\r\\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\\r\\ngiven him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\\r\\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, â\\x80\\x98You see now\\r\\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\\r\\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\\r\\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\\r\\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\\r\\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\\r\\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen the son sat down on the foxâ\\x80\\x99s tail, and away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\\r\\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\\r\\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. â\\x80\\x98I will give him the good one,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid he; â\\x80\\x98I am sure he deserves it.â\\x80\\x99 As he took up the golden saddle the\\r\\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\\r\\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\\r\\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\\r\\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\\r\\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, â\\x80\\x98Why\\r\\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\\r\\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\\r\\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\\r\\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\\r\\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\\r\\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\\r\\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\\r\\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\\r\\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house the guards\\r\\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, â\\x80\\x98You shall never\\r\\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\\r\\nthe view from my window.â\\x80\\x99 Now this hill was so big that the whole world\\r\\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\\r\\ndone very little, the fox came and said. â\\x80\\x98Lie down and go to sleep; I\\r\\nwill work for you.â\\x80\\x99 And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\\r\\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\\r\\nremoved he must give him the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\\r\\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, â\\x80\\x98We will have all\\r\\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the young man,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you will only listen,â\\x80\\x99 said the fox, â\\x80\\x98it can be done. When you come\\r\\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, â\\x80\\x9cHere\\r\\nshe is!â\\x80\\x9d Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\\r\\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\\r\\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\\r\\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\\r\\nfast as you can.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right: then the fox said, â\\x80\\x98When you come to the castle where\\r\\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\\r\\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\\r\\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\\r\\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\\r\\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\\r\\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\\r\\ncame, and said, â\\x80\\x98Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.â\\x80\\x99 But the\\r\\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, â\\x80\\x98I will at any rate give\\r\\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\\r\\nand sit down by the side of no river.â\\x80\\x99 Then away he went. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthought the young man, â\\x80\\x98it is no hard matter to keep that advice.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\\r\\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\\r\\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, â\\x80\\x98Two men\\r\\nare going to be hanged.â\\x80\\x99 As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\\r\\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, â\\x80\\x98Cannot they in any\\r\\nway be saved?â\\x80\\x99 But the people said â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 unless he would bestow all his\\r\\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\\r\\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\\r\\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\\r\\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, â\\x80\\x98Let us sit down by the\\r\\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.â\\x80\\x99 So he said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 and forgot the foxâ\\x80\\x99s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\\r\\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\\r\\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\\r\\nhome to the king their master, and said. â\\x80\\x98All this have we won by our\\r\\nlabour.â\\x80\\x99 Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\\r\\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the riverâ\\x80\\x99s bed: luckily it was\\r\\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\\r\\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\\r\\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\\r\\nhave befallen him: â\\x80\\x98Yet,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\\r\\nof my tail and hold fast.â\\x80\\x99 Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\\r\\nto him, as he got upon the bank, â\\x80\\x98Your brothers have set watch to kill\\r\\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.â\\x80\\x99 So he dressed himself as a poor\\r\\nman, and came secretly to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s court, and was scarcely within the\\r\\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\\r\\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\\r\\nbrothersâ\\x80\\x99 roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\\r\\nprincess given to him again; and after the kingâ\\x80\\x99s death he was heir to\\r\\nhis kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\\r\\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\\r\\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\\r\\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\\r\\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANS IN LUCK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\\r\\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\\r\\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\\r\\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\\r\\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\\r\\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\\r\\nknow about the matter?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\\r\\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, â\\x80\\x98Master, my time is up; I\\r\\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\\r\\nand let me go.â\\x80\\x99 And the master said, â\\x80\\x98You have been a faithful and good\\r\\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.â\\x80\\x99 Then he gave him a lump\\r\\nof silver as big as his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\\r\\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\\r\\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\\r\\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said Hans aloud, â\\x80\\x98what a\\r\\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\\r\\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\\r\\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.â\\x80\\x99 Hans did\\r\\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, â\\x80\\x98Well,\\r\\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I have this load to\\r\\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I canâ\\x80\\x99t hold up\\r\\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What do you say\\r\\nof making an exchange?â\\x80\\x99 said the horseman. â\\x80\\x98I will give you my horse,\\r\\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\\r\\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98With all my\\r\\nheart,â\\x80\\x99 said Hans: â\\x80\\x98but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\\r\\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\\r\\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, â\\x80\\x98When\\r\\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJip!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\\r\\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\\r\\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98No care and no sorrow,\\r\\n  A fig for the morrow!\\r\\n  Weâ\\x80\\x99ll laugh and be merry,\\r\\n  Sing neigh down derry!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\\r\\nsmacked his lips and cried â\\x80\\x98Jip!â\\x80\\x99 Away went the horse full gallop; and\\r\\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\\r\\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\\r\\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\\r\\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\\r\\nshepherd, â\\x80\\x98This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\\r\\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\\r\\nhis neck. However, Iâ\\x80\\x99m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\\r\\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\\r\\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\\r\\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at oneâ\\x80\\x99s leisure behind that\\r\\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\\r\\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe shepherd, â\\x80\\x98if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\\r\\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\\r\\nmyself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Done!â\\x80\\x99 said Hans, merrily. â\\x80\\x98What a noble heart that good man\\r\\nhas!â\\x80\\x99 thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\\r\\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\\r\\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\\r\\none. â\\x80\\x98If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\\r\\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\\r\\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\\r\\ncan I wish for more?â\\x80\\x99 When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\\r\\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\\r\\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\\r\\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\\r\\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\\r\\nclave to the roof of his mouth. â\\x80\\x98I can find a cure for this,â\\x80\\x99 thought\\r\\nhe; â\\x80\\x98now I will milk my cow and quench my thirstâ\\x80\\x99: so he tied her to the\\r\\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\\r\\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\\r\\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\\r\\nnot thought of looking to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\\r\\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\\r\\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\\r\\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\\r\\npig in a wheelbarrow. â\\x80\\x98What is the matter with you, my man?â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\\r\\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\\r\\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, â\\x80\\x98There, drink and refresh\\r\\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: donâ\\x80\\x99t you see she is an old\\r\\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas, alas!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nHans, â\\x80\\x98who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\\r\\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\\r\\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\\r\\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\\r\\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe butcher, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\\r\\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\\r\\npig for the cow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\\r\\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\\r\\nits leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\\r\\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\\r\\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\\r\\nlast got?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\\r\\ncountryman stopped to ask what was oâ\\x80\\x99clock; this led to further chat;\\r\\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\\r\\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\\r\\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\\r\\nchristening. â\\x80\\x98Feel,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\\r\\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\\r\\nit has lived so well!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re right,â\\x80\\x99 said Hans, as he weighed it in\\r\\nhis hand; â\\x80\\x98but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.â\\x80\\x99 Meantime the\\r\\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. â\\x80\\x98Hark ye!â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I canâ\\x80\\x99t help doing\\r\\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\\r\\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\\r\\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squireâ\\x80\\x99s pig. If\\r\\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\\r\\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. â\\x80\\x98Good man,â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98pray get me out\\r\\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\\r\\nbut he may have been the squireâ\\x80\\x99s for aught I can tell: you know this\\r\\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I ought\\r\\nto have something into the bargain,â\\x80\\x99 said the countryman; â\\x80\\x98give a fat\\r\\ngoose for a pig, indeed! â\\x80\\x98Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\\r\\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\\r\\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. â\\x80\\x98After all,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthought he, â\\x80\\x98that chap is pretty well taken in. I donâ\\x80\\x99t care whose pig\\r\\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\\r\\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\\r\\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\\r\\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\\r\\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\\r\\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\\r\\nworking and singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Oâ\\x80\\x99er hill and oâ\\x80\\x99er dale\\r\\n  So happy I roam,\\r\\n  Work light and live well,\\r\\n  All the world is my home;\\r\\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, â\\x80\\x98You must be well\\r\\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nother, â\\x80\\x98mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\\r\\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\\r\\nbeautiful goose?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And where\\r\\ndid you get the pig?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I gave a cow for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And the cow?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I gave a\\r\\nhorse for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And the horse?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I gave a lump of silver as big as my\\r\\nhead for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And the silver?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\\r\\nyears.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You have thriven well in the world hitherto,â\\x80\\x99 said the grinder,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\\r\\nin it, your fortune would be made.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Very true: but how is that to be\\r\\nmanaged?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,â\\x80\\x99 said the other;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\\r\\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\\r\\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How can you ask?â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nHans; â\\x80\\x98I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\\r\\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe goose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Now,â\\x80\\x99 said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\\r\\nthat lay by his side, â\\x80\\x98this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\\r\\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\\r\\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, â\\x80\\x98Surely I must have been born\\r\\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\\r\\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\\r\\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\\r\\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\\r\\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\\r\\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\\r\\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\\r\\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\\r\\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\\r\\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\\r\\nthe ugly heavy stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98How happy am I!â\\x80\\x99 cried he; â\\x80\\x98nobody was ever so lucky as I.â\\x80\\x99 Then up he\\r\\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\\r\\nhe reached his motherâ\\x80\\x99s house, and told her how very easy the road to\\r\\ngood luck was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\\r\\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\\r\\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\\r\\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\\r\\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\\r\\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\\r\\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\\r\\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\\r\\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\\r\\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\\r\\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\\r\\nbeautiful birds in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\\r\\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\\r\\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\\r\\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\\r\\nalone; and Jorindel said, â\\x80\\x98We must take care that we donâ\\x80\\x99t go too near\\r\\nto the fairyâ\\x80\\x99s castle.â\\x80\\x99 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\\r\\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\\r\\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\\r\\nbirches.\\r\\n\\r\\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\\r\\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\\r\\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\\r\\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\\r\\nat a loss to know what path to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\\r\\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\\r\\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\\r\\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\\r\\nJorinda was just singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\\r\\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\\r\\n  He mournâ\\x80\\x99d for the fate of his darling mate,\\r\\n  Well-a-day!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\\r\\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\\r\\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\\r\\nround them, and three times screamed:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\\r\\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\\r\\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\\r\\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\\r\\nchin that almost met one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\\r\\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\\r\\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\\r\\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Till the prisoner is fast,\\r\\n  And her doom is cast,\\r\\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\\r\\n  When the charm is around her,\\r\\n  And the spell has bound her,\\r\\n  Hie away! away!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\\r\\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\\r\\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\\r\\nwent her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98what\\r\\nwill become of me?â\\x80\\x99 He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\\r\\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\\r\\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\\r\\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\\r\\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\\r\\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\\r\\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\\r\\nfound his Jorinda again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\\r\\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\\r\\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\\r\\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\\r\\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\\r\\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\\r\\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\\r\\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\\r\\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\\r\\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\\r\\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\\r\\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\\r\\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\\r\\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\\r\\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\\r\\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\\r\\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\\r\\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\\r\\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\\r\\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\\r\\nthey walked together in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\\r\\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\\r\\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\\r\\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\\r\\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\\r\\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\\r\\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\\r\\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\\r\\ntowards the great city, â\\x80\\x98For there,â\\x80\\x99 thought he, â\\x80\\x98I may turn musician.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\\r\\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. â\\x80\\x98What makes you pant so, my\\r\\nfriend?â\\x80\\x99 said the ass. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said the dog, â\\x80\\x98my master was going to\\r\\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\\r\\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\\r\\nearn my livelihood?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Hark ye!â\\x80\\x99 said the ass, â\\x80\\x98I am going to the great\\r\\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\\r\\ndo in the same way?â\\x80\\x99 The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\\r\\nroad and making a most rueful face. â\\x80\\x98Pray, my good lady,â\\x80\\x99 said the ass,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the cat, â\\x80\\x98how can one be in good spirits when oneâ\\x80\\x99s life is in\\r\\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\\r\\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\\r\\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 said the ass, â\\x80\\x98by all means go with us to the great city; you are\\r\\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.â\\x80\\x99 The cat\\r\\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\\r\\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bravo!â\\x80\\x99 said the ass; â\\x80\\x98upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\\r\\nis all this about?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why,â\\x80\\x99 said the cock, â\\x80\\x98I was just now saying that\\r\\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\\r\\nthe cook donâ\\x80\\x99t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\\r\\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\\r\\non Sunday!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Heaven forbid!â\\x80\\x99 said the ass, â\\x80\\x98come with us Master\\r\\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\\r\\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\\r\\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98With all my\\r\\nheart,â\\x80\\x99 said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\\r\\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\\r\\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\\r\\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\\r\\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\\r\\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\\r\\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\\r\\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, â\\x80\\x98There must be a\\r\\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If that be the case,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe ass, â\\x80\\x98we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\\r\\nbest in the world!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Besides,â\\x80\\x99 added the dog, â\\x80\\x98I should not be the\\r\\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.â\\x80\\x99 So they walked off together\\r\\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\\r\\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\\r\\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\\r\\npeeped in. â\\x80\\x98Well, Donkey,â\\x80\\x99 said Chanticleer, â\\x80\\x98what do you see?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What\\r\\ndo I see?â\\x80\\x99 replied the ass. â\\x80\\x98Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\\r\\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That would\\r\\nbe a noble lodging for us,â\\x80\\x99 said the cock. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the ass, â\\x80\\x98if we\\r\\ncould only get inâ\\x80\\x99; so they consulted together how they should contrive\\r\\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\\r\\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\\r\\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dogâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the catâ\\x80\\x99s head. When\\r\\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\\r\\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\\r\\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\\r\\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\\r\\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\\r\\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\\r\\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\\r\\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\\r\\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\\r\\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\\r\\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\\r\\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\\r\\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\\r\\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\\r\\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\\r\\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\\r\\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\\r\\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\\r\\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\\r\\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\\r\\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\\r\\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\\r\\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\\r\\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\\r\\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\\r\\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\\r\\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\\r\\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\\r\\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\\r\\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\\r\\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\\r\\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Throw the rascal up here!â\\x80\\x99 After this the robbers never dared to go\\r\\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\\r\\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\\r\\nthis very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD SULTAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\\r\\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\\r\\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, â\\x80\\x98I will shoot\\r\\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.â\\x80\\x99 But his wife\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\\r\\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\\r\\nhis days.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But what can we do with him?â\\x80\\x99 said the shepherd, â\\x80\\x98he has not\\r\\na tooth in his head, and the thieves donâ\\x80\\x99t care for him at all; to\\r\\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\\r\\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\\r\\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\\r\\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\\r\\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\\r\\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. â\\x80\\x98Make yourself\\r\\neasy,â\\x80\\x99 said the wolf, â\\x80\\x98I will give you some good advice. Your master,\\r\\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\\r\\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\\r\\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\\r\\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\\r\\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\\r\\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\\r\\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\\r\\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.â\\x80\\x99 The dog liked this\\r\\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\\r\\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\\r\\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\\r\\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, â\\x80\\x98Old\\r\\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\\r\\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\\r\\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\\r\\nas long as he lives.â\\x80\\x99 So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\\r\\ncould wish for.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, â\\x80\\x98Now, my\\r\\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\\r\\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s fine fat sheep.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the Sultan; â\\x80\\x98I will be true to my master.â\\x80\\x99 However, the wolf\\r\\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\\r\\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\\r\\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\\r\\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\\r\\nhis locks for him finely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan â\\x80\\x98an old rogue,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\\r\\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\\r\\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s old\\r\\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\\r\\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\\r\\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the catâ\\x80\\x99s long tail standing\\r\\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\\r\\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\\r\\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\\r\\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\\r\\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\\r\\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\\r\\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\\r\\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\\r\\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\\r\\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, â\\x80\\x98Look up in the tree, there\\r\\nsits the one who is to blame.â\\x80\\x99 So they looked up, and espied the wolf\\r\\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\\r\\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\\r\\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\\r\\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\\r\\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\\r\\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\\r\\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\\r\\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\\r\\nbegan and said: â\\x80\\x98Dear friends, from whence do you come here?â\\x80\\x99 The coal\\r\\nreplied: â\\x80\\x98I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\\r\\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\\r\\nburnt to ashes.â\\x80\\x99 The bean said: â\\x80\\x98I too have escaped with a whole skin,\\r\\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\\r\\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And would a better\\r\\nfate have fallen to my lot?â\\x80\\x99 said the straw. â\\x80\\x98The old woman has\\r\\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\\r\\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But what are we to do now?â\\x80\\x99 said the coal.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I think,â\\x80\\x99 answered the bean, â\\x80\\x98that as we have so fortunately escaped\\r\\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\\r\\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\\r\\nrepair to a foreign country.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\\r\\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\\r\\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\\r\\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: â\\x80\\x98I will lay myself straight\\r\\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.â\\x80\\x99 The straw\\r\\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\\r\\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\\r\\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\\r\\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\\r\\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\\r\\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\\r\\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\\r\\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\\r\\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\\r\\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\\r\\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\\r\\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\\r\\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\\r\\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIAR ROSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\\r\\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\\r\\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\\r\\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\\r\\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\\r\\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\\r\\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\\r\\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\\r\\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\\r\\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\\r\\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, â\\x80\\x98I know what your wish is,\\r\\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\\r\\nsoon have a daughter.â\\x80\\x99 What the little fish had foretold soon came to\\r\\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\\r\\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\\r\\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\\r\\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\\r\\nto our little daughter.â\\x80\\x99 Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\\r\\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\\r\\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\\r\\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\\r\\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\\r\\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\\r\\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\\r\\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\\r\\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\\r\\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\\r\\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\\r\\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\\r\\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\\r\\nrevenge. So she cried out, â\\x80\\x98The kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\\r\\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.â\\x80\\x99 Then the twelfth of\\r\\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\\r\\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\\r\\nmischief; so her gift was, that the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, when the spindle\\r\\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\\r\\nhundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\\r\\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\\r\\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\\r\\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\\r\\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\\r\\nher loved her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\\r\\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\\r\\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\\r\\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\\r\\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\\r\\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\\r\\naway very busily. â\\x80\\x98Why, how now, good mother,â\\x80\\x99 said the princess; â\\x80\\x98what\\r\\nare you doing there?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Spinning,â\\x80\\x99 said the old lady, and nodded her\\r\\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. â\\x80\\x98How prettily that\\r\\nlittle thing turns round!â\\x80\\x99 said the princess, and took the spindle\\r\\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\\r\\nfairyâ\\x80\\x99s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\\r\\ndown lifeless on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\\r\\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\\r\\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\\r\\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\\r\\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\\r\\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\\r\\ngoose upon it for the kingâ\\x80\\x99s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\\r\\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\\r\\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\\r\\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\\r\\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\\r\\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\\r\\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\\r\\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\\r\\nRose (for so the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter was called): so that, from time to\\r\\ntime, several kingsâ\\x80\\x99 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\\r\\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\\r\\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\\r\\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many, many years there came a kingâ\\x80\\x99s son into that land: and an\\r\\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\\r\\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\\r\\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\\r\\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\\r\\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\\r\\ndied. Then the young prince said, â\\x80\\x98All this shall not frighten me; I\\r\\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.â\\x80\\x99 The old man tried to hinder him, but\\r\\nhe was bent upon going.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\\r\\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\\r\\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\\r\\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\\r\\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\\r\\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\\r\\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\\r\\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\\r\\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\\r\\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\\r\\nif she was going to beat the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\\r\\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\\r\\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\\r\\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\\r\\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\\r\\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\\r\\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\\r\\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\\r\\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\\r\\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\\r\\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\\r\\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\\r\\nwith the goose for the kingâ\\x80\\x99s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\\r\\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\\r\\nthe boy the box on his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\\r\\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\\r\\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\\r\\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\\r\\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, â\\x80\\x98Why are you so sad,\\r\\nmy friend?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Because,â\\x80\\x99 said the dog, â\\x80\\x98I am very very hungry, and have\\r\\nnothing to eat.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If that be all,â\\x80\\x99 answered the sparrow, â\\x80\\x98come with me\\r\\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.â\\x80\\x99 So on they\\r\\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcherâ\\x80\\x99s shop,\\r\\nthe sparrow said to the dog, â\\x80\\x98Stand there a little while till I peck you\\r\\ndown a piece of meat.â\\x80\\x99 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\\r\\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\\r\\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\\r\\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\\r\\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe sparrow, â\\x80\\x98you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\\r\\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.â\\x80\\x99 When the dog had\\r\\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, â\\x80\\x98Well, my good friend, have you\\r\\nhad enough now?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I have had plenty of meat,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98but I should\\r\\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Come with me then,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the sparrow, â\\x80\\x98and you shall soon have that too.â\\x80\\x99 So she took him\\r\\nto a bakerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\\r\\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\\r\\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\\r\\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98and\\r\\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.â\\x80\\x99 So they both went\\r\\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\\r\\nfar before the dog said, â\\x80\\x98I am very much tired--I should like to take a\\r\\nnap.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 answered the sparrow, â\\x80\\x98do so, and in the meantime\\r\\nI will perch upon that bush.â\\x80\\x99 So the dog stretched himself out on the\\r\\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\\r\\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\\r\\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\\r\\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x98Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.â\\x80\\x99 But the\\r\\ncarter, grumbling to himself, â\\x80\\x98You make it the worse for me, indeed!\\r\\nwhat can you do?â\\x80\\x99 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\\r\\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. â\\x80\\x98There,â\\x80\\x99 cried the\\r\\nsparrow, â\\x80\\x98thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\\r\\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do your worst, and welcome,â\\x80\\x99 said the brute, â\\x80\\x98what harm can you do me?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\\r\\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\\r\\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\\r\\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What an unlucky wretch I am!â\\x80\\x99 cried he. â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\\r\\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\\r\\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\\r\\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horseâ\\x80\\x99s head\\r\\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. â\\x80\\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\ncried he. â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 said the sparrow. And as the carter\\r\\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\\r\\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\\r\\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, â\\x80\\x98Miserable wretch\\r\\nthat I am!â\\x80\\x99 But the sparrow answered, â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\\r\\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\\r\\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\\r\\nspot. â\\x80\\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\\r\\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\\r\\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\\r\\nthird horse as he done the other two. â\\x80\\x98Alas! miserable wretch that I\\r\\nam!â\\x80\\x99 cried he. â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 answered the sparrow as she flew\\r\\naway; â\\x80\\x98now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\\r\\noverflowing with rage and vexation. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said he to his wife, â\\x80\\x98what\\r\\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\\r\\ndead.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas! husband,â\\x80\\x99 replied she, â\\x80\\x98and a wicked bird has come into\\r\\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\\r\\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\\r\\nup at such a rate!â\\x80\\x99 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\\r\\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\\r\\nmidst of them. â\\x80\\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99 cried the carter; for he saw\\r\\nthat the corn was almost all gone. â\\x80\\x98Not wretch enough yet!â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nsparrow; â\\x80\\x98thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!â\\x80\\x99 and away she flew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\\r\\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\\r\\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\\r\\non the outside of the window, and cried â\\x80\\x98Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\\r\\nthee thy life!â\\x80\\x99 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\\r\\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\\r\\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x98Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!â\\x80\\x99 Then he became mad and\\r\\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\\r\\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\\r\\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\\r\\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\\r\\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\\r\\nwife said, â\\x80\\x98Shall I kill her at once?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98that is letting\\r\\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\\r\\nher.â\\x80\\x99 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\\r\\nand cried, â\\x80\\x98Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!â\\x80\\x99 With that he\\r\\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, â\\x80\\x98Wife,\\r\\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.â\\x80\\x99 And the wife struck; but\\r\\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\\r\\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\\r\\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\\r\\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\\r\\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\\r\\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\\r\\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\\r\\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\\r\\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\\r\\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nA kingâ\\x80\\x99s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\\r\\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\\r\\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\\r\\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\\r\\nof his chamber was left open. But the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son soon fell asleep; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\\r\\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\\r\\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\\r\\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\\r\\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\\r\\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\\r\\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\\r\\nwho asked him where he was going. â\\x80\\x98I hardly know where I am going, or\\r\\nwhat I had better do,â\\x80\\x99 said the soldier; â\\x80\\x98but I think I should like very\\r\\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\\r\\nI might be a king.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the old dame, â\\x80\\x98that is no very hard\\r\\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\\r\\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\\r\\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, â\\x80\\x98As soon as you put that on\\r\\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\\r\\nprincesses wherever they go.â\\x80\\x99 When the soldier heard all this good\\r\\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\\r\\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\\r\\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\\r\\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\\r\\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\\r\\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\\r\\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\\r\\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\\r\\nheartily; and the eldest said, â\\x80\\x98This fellow too might have done a wiser\\r\\nthing than lose his life in this way!â\\x80\\x99 Then they rose up and opened\\r\\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\\r\\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\\r\\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it is, while\\r\\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\\r\\nbefall us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You simpleton,â\\x80\\x99 said the eldest, â\\x80\\x98you are always afraid;\\r\\nhave you forgotten how many kingsâ\\x80\\x99 sons have already watched in vain?\\r\\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\\r\\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\\r\\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\\r\\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\\r\\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\\r\\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\\r\\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\\r\\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\\r\\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\\r\\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, â\\x80\\x98All is not right; someone\\r\\ntook hold of my gown.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You silly creature!â\\x80\\x99 said the eldest, â\\x80\\x98it is\\r\\nnothing but a nail in the wall.â\\x80\\x99 Then down they all went, and at the\\r\\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\\r\\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\\r\\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\\r\\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\\r\\nyoungest daughter said again, â\\x80\\x98I am sure all is not right--did not you\\r\\nhear that noise? That never happened before.â\\x80\\x99 But the eldest said, â\\x80\\x98It\\r\\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\\r\\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\\r\\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\\r\\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\\r\\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\\r\\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\\r\\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\\r\\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\\r\\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\\r\\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\\r\\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\\r\\nseems very heavy today.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is only the heat of the weather,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nprincess: â\\x80\\x98I feel it very warm too.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\\r\\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\\r\\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\\r\\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\\r\\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\\r\\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\\r\\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\\r\\nsilenced her. They danced on till three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, and then\\r\\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\\r\\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\\r\\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\\r\\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\\r\\nto come again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\\r\\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\\r\\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, â\\x80\\x98Now all\\r\\nis quite safeâ\\x80\\x99; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\\r\\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\\r\\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\\r\\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\\r\\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\\r\\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\\r\\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\\r\\ntoken of where he had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\\r\\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\\r\\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\\r\\nsay. And when the king asked him. â\\x80\\x98Where do my twelve daughters dance at\\r\\nnight?â\\x80\\x99 he answered, â\\x80\\x98With twelve princes in a castle under ground.â\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\\r\\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\\r\\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\\r\\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\\r\\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\\r\\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\\r\\nanswered, â\\x80\\x98I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.â\\x80\\x99--And they\\r\\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nheir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\\r\\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\\r\\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\\r\\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\\r\\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\\r\\nBut the fish said, â\\x80\\x98Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\\r\\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, ho!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the man, â\\x80\\x98you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\\r\\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\\r\\nas you please!â\\x80\\x99 Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\\r\\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\\r\\non the wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\\r\\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\\r\\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. â\\x80\\x98Did not\\r\\nyou ask it for anything?â\\x80\\x99 said the wife, â\\x80\\x98we live very wretchedly here,\\r\\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\\r\\nlittle cottage.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\\r\\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\\r\\ngreen. And he stood at the waterâ\\x80\\x99s edge, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Well, what is her will?\\r\\nWhat does your wife want?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman, â\\x80\\x98she says that when\\r\\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\\r\\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\\r\\na snug little cottage.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home, then,â\\x80\\x99 said the fish; â\\x80\\x98she is in the\\r\\ncottage already!â\\x80\\x99 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\\r\\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. â\\x80\\x98Come in, come in!â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98is\\r\\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?â\\x80\\x99 And there was a\\r\\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\\r\\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\\r\\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nfisherman, â\\x80\\x98how happily we shall live now!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We will try to do so, at\\r\\nleast,â\\x80\\x99 said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\\r\\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\\r\\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\\r\\nto give us a castle.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t like to go to\\r\\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\\r\\npretty cottage to live in.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nonsense!â\\x80\\x99 said the wife; â\\x80\\x98he will do it\\r\\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\\r\\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\\r\\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what does she want now?â\\x80\\x99 said the fish. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the man,\\r\\ndolefully, â\\x80\\x98my wife wants to live in a stone castle.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home, then,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the fish; â\\x80\\x98she is standing at the gate of it already.â\\x80\\x99 So away went\\r\\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\\r\\ncastle. â\\x80\\x98See,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98is not this grand?â\\x80\\x99 With that they went into\\r\\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\\r\\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\\r\\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\\r\\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\\r\\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98now we\\r\\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\\r\\nour lives.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Perhaps we may,â\\x80\\x99 said the wife; â\\x80\\x98but let us sleep upon it,\\r\\nbefore we make up our minds to that.â\\x80\\x99 So they went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\\r\\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, â\\x80\\x98Get up, husband,\\r\\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Wife, wife,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the man, â\\x80\\x98why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then I will,â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98But, wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman, â\\x80\\x98how can you\\r\\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Husband,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98say\\r\\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.â\\x80\\x99 So the man went away\\r\\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\\r\\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\\r\\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what would she have now?â\\x80\\x99 said the fish. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said the poor\\r\\nman, â\\x80\\x98my wife wants to be king.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home,â\\x80\\x99 said the fish; â\\x80\\x98she is king\\r\\nalready.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\\r\\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\\r\\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\\r\\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\\r\\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. â\\x80\\x98Well, wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nfisherman, â\\x80\\x98are you king?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I am king.â\\x80\\x99 And when he had\\r\\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, â\\x80\\x98Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\\r\\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\\r\\nas we live.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how that may be,â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98never is a long\\r\\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\\r\\nthink I should like to be emperor.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas, wife! why should you wish to\\r\\nbe emperor?â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman. â\\x80\\x98Husband,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98go to the fish!\\r\\nI say I will be emperor.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, wife!â\\x80\\x99 replied the fisherman, â\\x80\\x98the fish\\r\\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\\r\\nsuch a thing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am king,â\\x80\\x99 said Ilsabill, â\\x80\\x98and you are my slave; so go\\r\\nat once!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\\r\\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.â\\x80\\x99 He\\r\\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\\r\\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\\r\\nwent as near as he could to the waterâ\\x80\\x99s brink, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What would she have now?â\\x80\\x99 said the fish. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98she wants to be emperor.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home,â\\x80\\x99 said the fish; â\\x80\\x98she is emperor\\r\\nalready.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\\r\\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\\r\\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\\r\\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\\r\\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\\r\\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\\r\\nup to her and said, â\\x80\\x98Wife, are you emperor?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I am\\r\\nemperor.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the man, as he gazed upon her, â\\x80\\x98what a fine thing\\r\\nit is to be emperor!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Husband,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98why should we stop at being\\r\\nemperor? I will be pope next.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98O wife, wife!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98how can you be\\r\\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Husband,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nshe, â\\x80\\x98I will be pope this very day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But,â\\x80\\x99 replied the husband, â\\x80\\x98the\\r\\nfish cannot make you pope.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What nonsense!â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98if he can make\\r\\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\\r\\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\\r\\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\\r\\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\\r\\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\\r\\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\\r\\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What does she want now?â\\x80\\x99 said the fish. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman, â\\x80\\x98my\\r\\nwife wants to be pope.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home,â\\x80\\x99 said the fish; â\\x80\\x98she is pope already.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\\r\\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\\r\\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\\r\\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\\r\\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\\r\\nlarger than a small rushlight. â\\x80\\x98Wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the fisherman, as he looked\\r\\nat all this greatness, â\\x80\\x98are you pope?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I am pope.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, wife,â\\x80\\x99 replied he, â\\x80\\x98it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\\r\\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I will think about\\r\\nthat,â\\x80\\x99 said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\\r\\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\\r\\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. â\\x80\\x98Ha!â\\x80\\x99 thought she,\\r\\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, â\\x80\\x98after all I cannot\\r\\nprevent the sun rising.â\\x80\\x99 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\\r\\nher husband, and said, â\\x80\\x98Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.â\\x80\\x99 The fisherman was half asleep, but the\\r\\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Alas, wife!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98cannot you be easy with being pope?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid she, â\\x80\\x98I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\\r\\nleave. Go to the fish at once!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\\r\\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\\r\\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\\r\\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\\r\\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\\r\\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\\r\\nand cried out, as well as he could:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What does she want now?â\\x80\\x99 said the fish. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98she wants to\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go home,â\\x80\\x99 said the fish, â\\x80\\x98to your pigsty\\r\\nagain.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there they live to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\\r\\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: â\\x80\\x98Brother\\r\\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is the King of birds,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the wolf, â\\x80\\x98before whom we must bow down.â\\x80\\x99 In reality the bird was\\r\\nthe willow-wren. â\\x80\\x98IF thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case,â\\x80\\x99 said the bear, â\\x80\\x98I should very\\r\\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is not\\r\\ndone quite as you seem to think,â\\x80\\x99 said the wolf; â\\x80\\x98you must wait until\\r\\nthe Queen comes,â\\x80\\x99 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\\r\\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\\r\\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\\r\\nback by the sleeve, and said: â\\x80\\x98No, you must wait until the lord and lady\\r\\nQueen have gone away again.â\\x80\\x99 So they took stock of the hole where the\\r\\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\\r\\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\\r\\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\\r\\nfive or six young ones lying there. â\\x80\\x98Is that the royal palace?â\\x80\\x99 cried\\r\\nthe bear; â\\x80\\x98it is a wretched palace, and you are not Kingâ\\x80\\x99s children, you\\r\\nare disreputable children!â\\x80\\x99 When the young wrens heard that, they were\\r\\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: â\\x80\\x98No, that we are not! Our parents are\\r\\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\\r\\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\\r\\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: â\\x80\\x98We will not so much as\\r\\ntouch one flyâ\\x80\\x99s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\\r\\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\\r\\nhere and has insulted us!â\\x80\\x99 Then the old King said: â\\x80\\x98Be easy, he shall\\r\\nbe punished,â\\x80\\x99 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bearâ\\x80\\x99s cave, and\\r\\ncalled in: â\\x80\\x98Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\\r\\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.â\\x80\\x99 Thus war was\\r\\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\\r\\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\\r\\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\\r\\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\\r\\nflies had to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\\r\\nto discover who was the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\\r\\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\\r\\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\\r\\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\\r\\ngeneral and lead us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Good,â\\x80\\x99 said the fox, â\\x80\\x98but what signal shall we\\r\\nagree upon?â\\x80\\x99 No one knew that, so the fox said: â\\x80\\x98I have a fine long\\r\\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\\r\\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\\r\\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.â\\x80\\x99 When the gnat had heard\\r\\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\\r\\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\\r\\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\\r\\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\\r\\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\\r\\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\\r\\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\\r\\nbeneath the foxâ\\x80\\x99s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\\r\\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\\r\\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\\r\\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\\r\\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\\r\\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\\r\\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heartâ\\x80\\x99s content, we have won\\r\\nthe battle!â\\x80\\x99 But the young wrens said: â\\x80\\x98We will not eat yet, the bear\\r\\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\\r\\nchildren, before we will do that.â\\x80\\x99 Then the willow-wren flew to the\\r\\nbearâ\\x80\\x99s hole and cried: â\\x80\\x98Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\\r\\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\\r\\nbe broken.â\\x80\\x99 So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\\r\\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\\r\\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\\r\\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\\r\\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\\r\\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\\r\\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\\r\\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\\r\\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\\r\\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\\r\\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\\r\\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\\r\\nher loss, and said, â\\x80\\x98Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\\r\\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\\r\\nworld.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98what can you\\r\\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe frog said, â\\x80\\x98I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\\r\\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\\r\\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\\r\\nagain.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What nonsense,â\\x80\\x99 thought the princess, â\\x80\\x98this silly frog is\\r\\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\\r\\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\\r\\nshall have what he asks.â\\x80\\x99 So she said to the frog, â\\x80\\x98Well, if you will\\r\\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.â\\x80\\x99 Then the frog put his head\\r\\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\\r\\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\\r\\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\\r\\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\\r\\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\\r\\nThe frog called after her, â\\x80\\x98Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\\r\\nsaid,â\\x80\\x99 But she did not stop to hear a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\\r\\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\\r\\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\\r\\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\\r\\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\\r\\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\\r\\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\\r\\nasked her what was the matter. â\\x80\\x98There is a nasty frog,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98at\\r\\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\\r\\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\\r\\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\\r\\nin.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king said to the young princess, â\\x80\\x98As you have given your word\\r\\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.â\\x80\\x99 She did so, and the frog hopped\\r\\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\\r\\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\\r\\nthe princess sat. â\\x80\\x98Pray lift me upon chair,â\\x80\\x99 said he to the princess,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98and let me sit next to you.â\\x80\\x99 As soon as she had done this, the frog\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.â\\x80\\x99 This\\r\\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, â\\x80\\x98Now I am\\r\\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.â\\x80\\x99 And the princess,\\r\\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\\r\\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\\r\\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now, then,â\\x80\\x99 thought the princess, â\\x80\\x98at last he is gone, and I shall be\\r\\ntroubled with him no more.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\\r\\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\\r\\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\\r\\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\\r\\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\\r\\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\\r\\nof her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\\r\\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\\r\\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\\r\\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. â\\x80\\x98You,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nprince, â\\x80\\x98have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\\r\\nbut that you should go with me into my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s kingdom, where I will\\r\\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying â\\x80\\x98Yesâ\\x80\\x99 to\\r\\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\\r\\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\\r\\nthe coach rode the princeâ\\x80\\x99s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\\r\\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\\r\\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\\r\\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\\r\\nmany years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\\r\\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\\r\\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\\r\\nfrom hunger,â\\x80\\x99 said the cat; â\\x80\\x98and you, little mouse, cannot venture\\r\\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.â\\x80\\x99 The good advice\\r\\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\\r\\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: â\\x80\\x98I know no\\r\\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\\r\\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\\r\\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.â\\x80\\x99 So the pot was\\r\\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\\r\\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: â\\x80\\x98I want to tell you something,\\r\\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\\r\\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\\r\\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\\r\\nafter the house by yourself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered the mouse, â\\x80\\x98by all\\r\\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\\r\\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.â\\x80\\x99 All this,\\r\\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\\r\\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\\r\\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\\r\\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\\r\\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\\r\\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, here you are again,â\\x80\\x99 said the mouse, â\\x80\\x98no doubt you have had a\\r\\nmerry day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98All went off well,â\\x80\\x99 answered the cat. â\\x80\\x98What name did they\\r\\ngive the child?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Top off!â\\x80\\x99 said the cat quite coolly. â\\x80\\x98Top off!â\\x80\\x99 cried\\r\\nthe mouse, â\\x80\\x98that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\\r\\nyour family?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What does that matter,â\\x80\\x99 said the cat, â\\x80\\x98it is no worse\\r\\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\\r\\nthe mouse: â\\x80\\x98You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\\r\\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\\r\\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.â\\x80\\x99 The good mouse consented,\\r\\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\\r\\nhalf the pot of fat. â\\x80\\x98Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\\r\\noneself,â\\x80\\x99 said she, and was quite satisfied with her dayâ\\x80\\x99s work. When\\r\\nshe went home the mouse inquired: â\\x80\\x98And what was the child christened?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Half-done,â\\x80\\x99 answered the cat. â\\x80\\x98Half-done! What are you saying? I\\r\\nnever heard the name in my life, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wager anything it is not in the\\r\\ncalendar!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catâ\\x80\\x99s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. â\\x80\\x98All good\\r\\nthings go in threes,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I am asked to stand godmother again.\\r\\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\\r\\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\\r\\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Top-off!\\r\\nHalf-done!â\\x80\\x99 answered the mouse, â\\x80\\x98they are such odd names, they make me\\r\\nvery thoughtful.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You sit at home,â\\x80\\x99 said the cat, â\\x80\\x98in your dark-grey\\r\\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, thatâ\\x80\\x99s because\\r\\nyou do not go out in the daytime.â\\x80\\x99 During the catâ\\x80\\x99s absence the mouse\\r\\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\\r\\nemptied the pot of fat. â\\x80\\x98When everything is eaten up one has some\\r\\npeace,â\\x80\\x99 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\\r\\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\\r\\nthe third child. â\\x80\\x98It will not please you more than the others,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\ncat. â\\x80\\x98He is called All-gone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98All-gone,â\\x80\\x99 cried the mouse â\\x80\\x98that is the\\r\\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\\r\\nwhat can that mean?â\\x80\\x99 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\\r\\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\\r\\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: â\\x80\\x98Come, cat,\\r\\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\\r\\nshall enjoy that.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered the cat, â\\x80\\x98you will enjoy it as much\\r\\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\\r\\nwindow.â\\x80\\x99 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\\r\\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nmouse, â\\x80\\x98now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\\r\\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\\r\\ntop off, then half-done, then--â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Will you hold your tongue,â\\x80\\x99 cried the\\r\\ncat, â\\x80\\x98one word more, and I will eat you too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98All-goneâ\\x80\\x99 was already on\\r\\nthe poor mouseâ\\x80\\x99s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\\r\\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\\r\\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\\r\\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\\r\\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\\r\\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\\r\\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\\r\\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\\r\\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\\r\\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\\r\\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\\r\\nher into the bridegroomâ\\x80\\x99s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\\r\\nNow the princessâ\\x80\\x99s horse was the fairyâ\\x80\\x99s gift, and it was called Falada,\\r\\nand could speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\\r\\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\\r\\nand gave it to the princess, and said, â\\x80\\x98Take care of it, dear child; for\\r\\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.â\\x80\\x99 Then they all took\\r\\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\\r\\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\\r\\nbridegroomâ\\x80\\x99s kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\\r\\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, â\\x80\\x98Pray get down, and fetch\\r\\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\\r\\ndrink.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nay,â\\x80\\x99 said the maid, â\\x80\\x98if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\\r\\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\\r\\nlonger.â\\x80\\x99 Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\\r\\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\\r\\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, â\\x80\\x98Alas! what will become of me?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\\r\\nmaidâ\\x80\\x99s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\\r\\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\\r\\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maidâ\\x80\\x99s rude\\r\\nspeech, and said, â\\x80\\x98Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\\r\\nmy golden cup.â\\x80\\x99 But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\\r\\nthan before: â\\x80\\x98Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\\r\\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What will become of me?â\\x80\\x99 And the lock of hair answered her again:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\\r\\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\\r\\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\\r\\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\\r\\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\\r\\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, â\\x80\\x98I shall ride upon Falada,\\r\\nand you may have my horse insteadâ\\x80\\x99; so she was forced to give up her\\r\\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\\r\\nmaidâ\\x80\\x99s shabby ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\\r\\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\\r\\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\\r\\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\\r\\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\\r\\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\\r\\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\\r\\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\\r\\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\\r\\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\\r\\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\\r\\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\\r\\nstanding in the court below. â\\x80\\x98I brought her with me for the sake of her\\r\\ncompany on the road,â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98pray give the girl some work to do,\\r\\nthat she may not be idle.â\\x80\\x99 The old king could not for some time think\\r\\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, â\\x80\\x98I have a lad who takes\\r\\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.â\\x80\\x99 Now the name of this lad,\\r\\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the kingâ\\x80\\x99s geese, was\\r\\nCurdken.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the false bride said to the prince, â\\x80\\x98Dear husband, pray do me one\\r\\npiece of kindness.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That I will,â\\x80\\x99 said the prince. â\\x80\\x98Then tell one of\\r\\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\\r\\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the roadâ\\x80\\x99; but the truth was,\\r\\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\\r\\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\\r\\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\\r\\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Faladaâ\\x80\\x99s head against a large\\r\\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\\r\\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\\r\\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\\r\\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\\r\\nshe said sorrowfully:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\\r\\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\\r\\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\\r\\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\\r\\nlocks out, but she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdkenâ\\x80\\x99s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  Oâ\\x80\\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirlâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all combâ\\x80\\x99d and curlâ\\x80\\x99d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdkenâ\\x80\\x99s hat; and\\r\\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\\r\\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\\r\\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\\r\\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\\r\\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\\r\\ngirl looked up at Faladaâ\\x80\\x99s head, and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\\r\\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\\r\\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdkenâ\\x80\\x99s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  Oâ\\x80\\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirlâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all combâ\\x80\\x99d and curlâ\\x80\\x99d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\\r\\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\\r\\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\\r\\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\\r\\nlonger.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why?â\\x80\\x99 said the king. â\\x80\\x98Because, instead of doing any good, she\\r\\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.â\\x80\\x99 Then the king made him tell him\\r\\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, â\\x80\\x98When we go in the morning through\\r\\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\\r\\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answers:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\\r\\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\\r\\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\\r\\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\\r\\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\\r\\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\\r\\nhid himself in a bush by the meadowâ\\x80\\x99s side; and he soon saw with his own\\r\\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\\r\\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\\r\\nsay:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdkenâ\\x80\\x99s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  Oâ\\x80\\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirlâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all combâ\\x80\\x99d and curlâ\\x80\\x99d!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdkenâ\\x80\\x99s hat, and away\\r\\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\\r\\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\\r\\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\\r\\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, â\\x80\\x98That\\r\\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\\r\\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\\r\\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\\r\\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\\r\\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\\r\\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\\r\\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\\r\\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\\r\\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\\r\\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\\r\\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\\r\\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\\r\\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\\r\\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\\r\\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\\r\\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\\r\\nbehave thus. â\\x80\\x98Nothing better,â\\x80\\x99 said this false bride, â\\x80\\x98than that she\\r\\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\\r\\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\\r\\nstreet till she was dead.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thou art she!â\\x80\\x99 said the old king; â\\x80\\x98and as\\r\\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.â\\x80\\x99 And the young\\r\\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\\r\\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\\r\\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The nuts are quite ripe now,â\\x80\\x99 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\\r\\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98With all my heart,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nPartlet, â\\x80\\x98let us go and make a holiday of it together.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\\r\\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\\r\\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\\r\\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\\r\\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\\r\\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\\r\\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\\r\\nhome. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a good joke!â\\x80\\x99 said Chanticleer; â\\x80\\x98no, that will never do;\\r\\nI had rather by half walk home; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll sit on the box and be coachman,\\r\\nif you like, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not draw.â\\x80\\x99 While this was passing, a duck came\\r\\nquacking up and cried out, â\\x80\\x98You thieving vagabonds, what business have\\r\\nyou in my grounds? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give it you well for your insolence!â\\x80\\x99 and upon\\r\\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\\r\\ncoward, and returned the duckâ\\x80\\x99s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\\r\\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\\r\\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\\r\\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, â\\x80\\x98Now,\\r\\nduck, get on as fast as you can.â\\x80\\x99 And away they went at a pretty good\\r\\npace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\\r\\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, â\\x80\\x98Stop, stop!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\\r\\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\\r\\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\\r\\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\\r\\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\\r\\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\\r\\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\\r\\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\\r\\ntread on Partletâ\\x80\\x99s toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\\r\\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\\r\\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\\r\\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\\r\\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\\r\\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\\r\\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\\r\\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\\r\\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\\r\\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\\r\\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\\r\\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\\r\\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlordâ\\x80\\x99s easy chair\\r\\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\\r\\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\\r\\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\\r\\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\\r\\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\\r\\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\\r\\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bless me!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98all the world seems to have a design against my\\r\\nhead this morningâ\\x80\\x99: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\\r\\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\\r\\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\\r\\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\\r\\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\\r\\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\\r\\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\\r\\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\\r\\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\\r\\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, â\\x80\\x98Where\\r\\nare you going?â\\x80\\x99 And Chanticleer replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98All on our way\\r\\n  A visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cat said, â\\x80\\x98Take me with you,â\\x80\\x99 Chanticleer said, â\\x80\\x98With all my\\r\\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\\r\\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\\r\\n  Now, mice, be ready,\\r\\n  And, wheels, run steady!\\r\\n  For we are going a visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\\r\\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbesâ\\x80\\x99s house, he was not at home; so the mice\\r\\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\\r\\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\\r\\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\\r\\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\\r\\nup in the towel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\\r\\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\\r\\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\\r\\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\\r\\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\\r\\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\\r\\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\\r\\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\\r\\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\\r\\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\\r\\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\\r\\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\\r\\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\\r\\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\\r\\nChanticleer, â\\x80\\x98Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\\r\\nshall be choked.â\\x80\\x99 Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\\r\\nwill be choked by a great nut.â\\x80\\x99 The river said, â\\x80\\x98Run first to the bride,\\r\\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.â\\x80\\x99 Chanticleer ran to\\r\\nthe bride, and said, â\\x80\\x98Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\\r\\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\\r\\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.â\\x80\\x99 But the bride\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\\r\\nin the garden.â\\x80\\x99 Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\\r\\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\\r\\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\\r\\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\\r\\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\\r\\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\\r\\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\\r\\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\\r\\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\\r\\nmet the fox. â\\x80\\x98Where are you going, Chanticleer?â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98To bury my\\r\\nPartlet,â\\x80\\x99 said the other. â\\x80\\x98May I go with you?â\\x80\\x99 said the fox. â\\x80\\x98Yes; but\\r\\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. â\\x80\\x98How shall we get\\r\\nover?â\\x80\\x99 said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, â\\x80\\x98I will lay myself across,\\r\\nand you may pass over upon me.â\\x80\\x99 But as the mice were going over, the\\r\\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\\r\\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\\r\\nshall pass over upon me.â\\x80\\x99 So he laid himself down; but they managed\\r\\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\\r\\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\\r\\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\\r\\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\\r\\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\\r\\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\\r\\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\\r\\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\\r\\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\\r\\ndied too; and so all were dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRAPUNZEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\\r\\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\\r\\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\\r\\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\\r\\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\\r\\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\\r\\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\\r\\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\\r\\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\\r\\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\\r\\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\\r\\nasked: â\\x80\\x98What ails you, dear wife?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 she replied, â\\x80\\x98if I canâ\\x80\\x99t eat\\r\\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\\r\\ndie.â\\x80\\x99 The man, who loved her, thought: â\\x80\\x98Sooner than let your wife die,\\r\\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\\r\\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\\r\\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\\r\\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\\r\\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\\r\\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\\r\\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\\r\\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\\r\\nhim. â\\x80\\x98How can you dare,â\\x80\\x99 said she with angry look, â\\x80\\x98descend into my\\r\\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\\r\\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\\r\\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\\r\\nhad not got some to eat.â\\x80\\x99 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\\r\\nsoftened, and said to him: â\\x80\\x98If the case be as you say, I will allow\\r\\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\\r\\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\\r\\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\\r\\nmother.â\\x80\\x99 The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\\r\\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\\r\\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\\r\\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\\r\\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\\r\\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\\r\\nbeneath it and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\\r\\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\\r\\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\\r\\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son rode through\\r\\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\\r\\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\\r\\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\\r\\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\\r\\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\\r\\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\\r\\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\\r\\nclimbed up to her. â\\x80\\x98If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\\r\\nwill try my fortune,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and the next day when it began to grow\\r\\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the hair fell down and the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son climbed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\\r\\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son began to talk to\\r\\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\\r\\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\\r\\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\\r\\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\\r\\nthought: â\\x80\\x98He will love me more than old Dame Gothel doesâ\\x80\\x99; and she said\\r\\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: â\\x80\\x98I will willingly go away with\\r\\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\\r\\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\\r\\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.â\\x80\\x99 They\\r\\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\\r\\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\\r\\nonce Rapunzel said to her: â\\x80\\x98Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\\r\\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young kingâ\\x80\\x99s son--he\\r\\nis with me in a moment.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah! you wicked child,â\\x80\\x99 cried the enchantress.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\\r\\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!â\\x80\\x99 In her anger she clutched\\r\\nRapunzelâ\\x80\\x99s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\\r\\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\\r\\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\\r\\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\\r\\ngrief and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\\r\\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\\r\\nwindow, and when the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son came and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nshe let the hair down. The kingâ\\x80\\x99s son ascended, but instead of finding\\r\\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\\r\\nwicked and venomous looks. â\\x80\\x98Aha!â\\x80\\x99 she cried mockingly, â\\x80\\x98you would fetch\\r\\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\\r\\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\\r\\nlost to you; you will never see her again.â\\x80\\x99 The kingâ\\x80\\x99s son was beside\\r\\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\\r\\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\\r\\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\\r\\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\\r\\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\\r\\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\\r\\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\\r\\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\\r\\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\\r\\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\\r\\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\\r\\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\\r\\ncontented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFUNDEVOGEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\\r\\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\\r\\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\\r\\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\\r\\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\\r\\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.â\\x80\\x99 He\\r\\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\\r\\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\\r\\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\\r\\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\\r\\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\\r\\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, â\\x80\\x98Listen, old Sanna, why are you\\r\\nfetching so much water?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\\r\\ntell you why.â\\x80\\x99 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\\r\\nand then the cook said: â\\x80\\x98Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\\r\\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\\r\\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\\r\\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.â\\x80\\x99 Fundevogel\\r\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.â\\x80\\x99 Then said Lina: â\\x80\\x98Then\\r\\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\\r\\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\\r\\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\\r\\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\\r\\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\\r\\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\\r\\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\\r\\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\\r\\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\\r\\nalarmed, and she said to herself: â\\x80\\x98What shall I say now when the\\r\\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\\r\\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\\r\\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\\r\\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\\r\\nsaid to Fundevogel: â\\x80\\x98Never leave me, and I will never leave you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nFundevogel said: â\\x80\\x98Neither now, nor ever.â\\x80\\x99 Then said Lina: â\\x80\\x98Do you become\\r\\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.â\\x80\\x99 When the three servants came to\\r\\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\\r\\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: â\\x80\\x98There is nothing to be done\\r\\nhere,â\\x80\\x99 and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\\r\\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\\r\\nold cook scolded and said: â\\x80\\x98You simpletons, you should have cut the\\r\\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\\r\\nyou; go, and do it at once.â\\x80\\x99 They had therefore to go out and look for\\r\\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\\r\\nThen Lina said: â\\x80\\x98Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99 Fundevogel said: â\\x80\\x98Neither now; nor ever.â\\x80\\x99 Said Lina: â\\x80\\x98Then do you\\r\\nbecome a church, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be the chandelier in it.â\\x80\\x99 So when the three\\r\\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\\r\\nit. They said therefore to each other: â\\x80\\x98What can we do here, let us go\\r\\nhome.â\\x80\\x99 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\\r\\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\\r\\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: â\\x80\\x98You fools! why\\r\\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\\r\\nwith you?â\\x80\\x99 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\\r\\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\\r\\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\\r\\nafter them. Then said Lina: â\\x80\\x98Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\\r\\nnever leave you.â\\x80\\x99 Then said Fundevogel: â\\x80\\x98Neither now, nor ever.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSaid Lina: â\\x80\\x98Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.â\\x80\\x99 The cook,\\r\\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\\r\\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\\r\\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\\r\\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\\r\\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne summerâ\\x80\\x99s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\\r\\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\\r\\na peasant woman down the street crying: â\\x80\\x98Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\\r\\ncheap!â\\x80\\x99 This rang pleasantly in the tailorâ\\x80\\x99s ears; he stretched his\\r\\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: â\\x80\\x98Come up here, dear woman;\\r\\nhere you will get rid of your goods.â\\x80\\x99 The woman came up the three steps\\r\\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\\r\\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\\r\\nat length said: â\\x80\\x98The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\\r\\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\\r\\nconsequence.â\\x80\\x99 The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\\r\\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. â\\x80\\x98Now, this jam\\r\\nshall be blessed by God,â\\x80\\x99 cried the little tailor, â\\x80\\x98and give me health\\r\\nand strengthâ\\x80\\x99; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\\r\\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. â\\x80\\x98This wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntaste bitter,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but I will just finish the jacket before I\\r\\ntake a bite.â\\x80\\x99 He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\\r\\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\\r\\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\\r\\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. â\\x80\\x98Hi! who invited you?â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\\r\\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\\r\\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\\r\\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\\r\\nand saying: â\\x80\\x98Wait, and I will give it to you,â\\x80\\x99 struck it mercilessly on\\r\\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\\r\\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. â\\x80\\x98Are you a fellow of that\\r\\nsort?â\\x80\\x99 said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. â\\x80\\x98The whole\\r\\ntown shall know of this!â\\x80\\x99 And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\\r\\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: â\\x80\\x98Seven at\\r\\none stroke!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What, the town!â\\x80\\x99 he continued, â\\x80\\x98the whole world shall hear\\r\\nof it!â\\x80\\x99 and his heart wagged with joy like a lambâ\\x80\\x99s tail. The tailor\\r\\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\\r\\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\\r\\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\\r\\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\\r\\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\\r\\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\\r\\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\\r\\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\\r\\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\\r\\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\\r\\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\\r\\nHave you any inclination to go with me?â\\x80\\x99 The giant looked contemptuously\\r\\nat the tailor, and said: â\\x80\\x98You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, indeed?â\\x80\\x99 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\\r\\nshowed the giant the girdle, â\\x80\\x98there may you read what kind of a man I\\r\\nam!â\\x80\\x99 The giant read: â\\x80\\x98Seven at one stroke,â\\x80\\x99 and thought that they had\\r\\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\\r\\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\\r\\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\\r\\nof it. â\\x80\\x98Do that likewise,â\\x80\\x99 said the giant, â\\x80\\x98if you have strength.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Is\\r\\nthat all?â\\x80\\x99 said the tailor, â\\x80\\x98that is childâ\\x80\\x99s play with us!â\\x80\\x99 and put his\\r\\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\\r\\nthe liquid ran out of it. â\\x80\\x98Faith,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98that was a little better,\\r\\nwasnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\\r\\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\\r\\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. â\\x80\\x98Now, little mite of a man, do\\r\\nthat likewise,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well thrown,â\\x80\\x99 said the tailor, â\\x80\\x98but after all the stone\\r\\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\\r\\nback at all,â\\x80\\x99 and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\\r\\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\\r\\nrose, flew away and did not come back. â\\x80\\x98How does that shot please you,\\r\\ncomrade?â\\x80\\x99 asked the tailor. â\\x80\\x98You can certainly throw,â\\x80\\x99 said the giant,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.â\\x80\\x99 He\\r\\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\\r\\nthe ground, and said: â\\x80\\x98If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\\r\\ntree out of the forest.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Readily,â\\x80\\x99 answered the little man; â\\x80\\x98take you\\r\\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\\r\\nafter all, they are the heaviest.â\\x80\\x99 The giant took the trunk on his\\r\\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\\r\\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\\r\\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\\r\\nwhistled the song: â\\x80\\x98Three tailors rode forth from the gate,â\\x80\\x99 as if\\r\\ncarrying the tree were childâ\\x80\\x99s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\\r\\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: â\\x80\\x98Hark\\r\\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!â\\x80\\x99 The tailor sprang nimbly down,\\r\\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\\r\\nto the giant: â\\x80\\x98You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\\r\\nthe tree!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\\r\\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\\r\\ndown, gave it into the tailorâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\\r\\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\\r\\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\\r\\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: â\\x80\\x98What is\\r\\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There is no\\r\\nlack of strength,â\\x80\\x99 answered the little tailor. â\\x80\\x98Do you think that could\\r\\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\\r\\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\\r\\nJump as I did, if you can do it.â\\x80\\x99 The giant made the attempt but he\\r\\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\\r\\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant said: â\\x80\\x98If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\\r\\ncavern and spend the night with us.â\\x80\\x99 The little tailor was willing, and\\r\\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\\r\\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\\r\\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: â\\x80\\x98It is much\\r\\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.â\\x80\\x99 The giant showed him a bed, and\\r\\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\\r\\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\\r\\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\\r\\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\\r\\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\\r\\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\\r\\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\\r\\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\\r\\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\\r\\ngreat hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\\r\\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\\r\\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\\r\\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\\r\\nread on his girdle: â\\x80\\x98Seven at one stroke.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said they, â\\x80\\x98what does\\r\\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\\r\\nlord.â\\x80\\x99 They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\\r\\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\\r\\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\\r\\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\\r\\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\\r\\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\\r\\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. â\\x80\\x98For this very reason have\\r\\nI come here,â\\x80\\x99 the tailor replied, â\\x80\\x98I am ready to enter the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nservice.â\\x80\\x99 He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\\r\\nwas assigned him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\\r\\nhim a thousand miles away. â\\x80\\x98What is to be the end of this?â\\x80\\x99 they said\\r\\namong themselves. â\\x80\\x98If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\\r\\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\\r\\nhim.â\\x80\\x99 They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\\r\\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. â\\x80\\x98We are not prepared,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthey, â\\x80\\x98to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.â\\x80\\x99 The king was\\r\\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\\r\\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\\r\\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\\r\\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\\r\\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\\r\\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\\r\\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\\r\\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\\r\\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\\r\\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\\r\\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\\r\\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!â\\x80\\x99 thought the\\r\\nlittle tailor. â\\x80\\x98One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\\r\\nkingdom every day of oneâ\\x80\\x99s life!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes,â\\x80\\x99 he replied, â\\x80\\x98I will soon\\r\\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\\r\\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\\r\\ntwo.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\\r\\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\\r\\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\\r\\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\\r\\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\\r\\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\\r\\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\\r\\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\\r\\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: â\\x80\\x98Why are you\\r\\nknocking me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You must be dreaming,â\\x80\\x99 said the other, â\\x80\\x98I am not knocking\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99 They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\\r\\nthrew a stone down on the second. â\\x80\\x98What is the meaning of this?â\\x80\\x99 cried\\r\\nthe other â\\x80\\x98Why are you pelting me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am not pelting you,â\\x80\\x99 answered\\r\\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\\r\\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\\r\\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\\r\\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. â\\x80\\x98That\\r\\nis too bad!â\\x80\\x99 cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\\r\\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\\r\\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\\r\\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\\r\\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. â\\x80\\x98It is\\r\\na lucky thing,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98that they did not tear up the tree on which\\r\\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\\r\\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.â\\x80\\x99 He drew out his sword and gave\\r\\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\\r\\nhorsemen and said: â\\x80\\x98The work is done; I have finished both of them\\r\\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\\r\\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\\r\\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But are you not\\r\\nwounded?â\\x80\\x99 asked the horsemen. â\\x80\\x98You need not concern yourself about\\r\\nthat,â\\x80\\x99 answered the tailor, â\\x80\\x98they have not bent one hair of mine.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\\r\\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\\r\\ntorn-up trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\\r\\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\\r\\nrid of the hero. â\\x80\\x98Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\\r\\nkingdom,â\\x80\\x99 said he to him, â\\x80\\x98you must perform one more heroic deed. In\\r\\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\\r\\nit first.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\\r\\nblow, is my kind of affair.â\\x80\\x99 He took a rope and an axe with him, went\\r\\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\\r\\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\\r\\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\\r\\nhorn without more ado. â\\x80\\x98Softly, softly; it canâ\\x80\\x99t be done as quickly as\\r\\nthat,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\\r\\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\\r\\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\\r\\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\\r\\nwas caught. â\\x80\\x98Now, I have got the bird,â\\x80\\x99 said the tailor, and came out\\r\\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\\r\\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\\r\\nbeast away and took it to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\\r\\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\\r\\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\\r\\nhelp. â\\x80\\x98Willingly,â\\x80\\x99 said the tailor, â\\x80\\x98that is childâ\\x80\\x99s play!â\\x80\\x99 He did not\\r\\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\\r\\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\\r\\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\\r\\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\\r\\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\\r\\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\\r\\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\\r\\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\\r\\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\\r\\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\\r\\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\\r\\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\\r\\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\\r\\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\\r\\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\\r\\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\\r\\nking was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\\r\\nnight: â\\x80\\x98Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\\r\\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.â\\x80\\x99 Then she discovered in what\\r\\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\\r\\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\\r\\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\\r\\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\\r\\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\\r\\nworld.â\\x80\\x99 The woman was satisfied with this; but the kingâ\\x80\\x99s armour-bearer,\\r\\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\\r\\nthe whole plot. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll put a screw into that business,â\\x80\\x99 said the little\\r\\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\\r\\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\\r\\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\\r\\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: â\\x80\\x98Boy, make me the doublet\\r\\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\\r\\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\\r\\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\\r\\noutside the room.â\\x80\\x99 When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\\r\\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\\r\\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\\r\\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\\r\\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\\r\\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\\r\\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\\r\\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\\r\\ngroaned and said to his wife: â\\x80\\x98What is to become of us? How are we\\r\\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\\r\\nourselves?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, husband,â\\x80\\x99 answered the woman, â\\x80\\x98early\\r\\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\\r\\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\\r\\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\\r\\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\\r\\nrid of them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98I will not do that; how can I\\r\\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\\r\\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98O, you fool!â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98then we\\r\\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\\r\\ncoffins,â\\x80\\x99 and she left him no peace until he consented. â\\x80\\x98But I feel very\\r\\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,â\\x80\\x99 said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\\r\\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\\r\\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: â\\x80\\x98Now all is over with us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Be quiet,\\r\\nGretel,â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, â\\x80\\x98do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\\r\\nto help us.â\\x80\\x99 And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\\r\\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\\r\\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\\r\\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\\r\\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\\r\\nback and said to Gretel: â\\x80\\x98Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\\r\\npeace, God will not forsake us,â\\x80\\x99 and he lay down again in his bed. When\\r\\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\\r\\ntwo children, saying: â\\x80\\x98Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\\r\\nforest to fetch wood.â\\x80\\x99 She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\\r\\nfor you will get nothing else.â\\x80\\x99 Gretel took the bread under her apron,\\r\\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\\r\\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\\r\\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\\r\\nHis father said: â\\x80\\x98Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\\r\\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\r\\nfather,â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, â\\x80\\x98I am looking at my little white cat, which is\\r\\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.â\\x80\\x99 The wife said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\\r\\nshining on the chimneys.â\\x80\\x99 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\\r\\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\\r\\nout of his pocket on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: â\\x80\\x98Now,\\r\\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\\r\\nbe cold.â\\x80\\x99 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\\r\\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\\r\\nvery high, the woman said: â\\x80\\x98Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\\r\\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\\r\\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\\r\\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\\r\\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\\r\\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\\r\\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\\r\\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\\r\\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\\r\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98How are we to get out of the forest now?â\\x80\\x99 But Hansel comforted\\r\\nher and said: â\\x80\\x98Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\\r\\nwill soon find the way.â\\x80\\x99 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\\r\\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\\r\\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\\r\\nto their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\\r\\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: â\\x80\\x98You naughty\\r\\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\\r\\nnever coming back at all!â\\x80\\x99 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\\r\\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\\r\\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\\r\\nfather: â\\x80\\x98Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\\r\\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\\r\\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\\r\\nmeans of saving ourselves!â\\x80\\x99 The manâ\\x80\\x99s heart was heavy, and he thought:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\\r\\nchildren.â\\x80\\x99 The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\\r\\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\\r\\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\\r\\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\\r\\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\\r\\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\\r\\nlittle sister, and said: â\\x80\\x98Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\\r\\ngood God will help us.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\\r\\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\\r\\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\\r\\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hansel, why do you stop and look round?â\\x80\\x99 said the father, â\\x80\\x98go on.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\\r\\nwants to say goodbye to me,â\\x80\\x99 answered Hansel. â\\x80\\x98Fool!â\\x80\\x99 said the woman,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\\r\\non the chimney.â\\x80\\x99 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\\r\\non the path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\\r\\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\\r\\nthe mother said: â\\x80\\x98Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\\r\\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\\r\\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\\r\\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\\r\\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\\r\\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: â\\x80\\x98Just wait,\\r\\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\\r\\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\\r\\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\\r\\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: â\\x80\\x98We shall soon find the way,â\\x80\\x99 but\\r\\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\\r\\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\\r\\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\\r\\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\\r\\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. They\\r\\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\\r\\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\\r\\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\\r\\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\\r\\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\\r\\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\\r\\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\\r\\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\\r\\nwere of clear sugar. â\\x80\\x98We will set to work on that,â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, â\\x80\\x98and\\r\\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\\r\\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.â\\x80\\x99 Hansel reached up above, and\\r\\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\\r\\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\\r\\nfrom the parlour:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\\r\\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98The wind, the wind,\\r\\n  The heaven-born wind,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\\r\\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\\r\\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\\r\\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\\r\\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\\r\\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\\r\\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: â\\x80\\x98Oh, you dear\\r\\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\\r\\nharm shall happen to you.â\\x80\\x99 She took them both by the hand, and led them\\r\\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\\r\\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\\r\\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\\r\\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\\r\\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\\r\\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\\r\\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\\r\\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\\r\\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\\r\\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\\r\\nmalice, and said mockingly: â\\x80\\x98I have them, they shall not escape me\\r\\nagain!â\\x80\\x99 Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\\r\\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\\r\\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: â\\x80\\x98That\\r\\nwill be a dainty mouthful!â\\x80\\x99 Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\\r\\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\\r\\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\\r\\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: â\\x80\\x98Get up, lazy thing, fetch\\r\\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\\r\\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\\r\\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\\r\\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\\r\\ncried: â\\x80\\x98Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\\r\\nbe fat.â\\x80\\x99 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\\r\\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\\r\\nHanselâ\\x80\\x99s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\\r\\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\\r\\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. â\\x80\\x98Now, then,\\r\\nGretel,â\\x80\\x99 she cried to the girl, â\\x80\\x98stir yourself, and bring some water.\\r\\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.â\\x80\\x99 Ah,\\r\\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\\r\\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! â\\x80\\x98Dear God, do help us,â\\x80\\x99 she\\r\\ncried. â\\x80\\x98If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\\r\\nat any rate have died together.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Just keep your noise to yourself,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the old woman, â\\x80\\x98it wonâ\\x80\\x99t help you at all.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\\r\\nthe water, and light the fire. â\\x80\\x98We will bake first,â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.â\\x80\\x99 She pushed poor\\r\\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Creep in,â\\x80\\x99 said the witch, â\\x80\\x98and see if it is properly heated, so that\\r\\nwe can put the bread in.â\\x80\\x99 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\\r\\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\\r\\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: â\\x80\\x98I do not know how I am\\r\\nto do it; how do I get in?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Silly goose,â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman. â\\x80\\x98The door\\r\\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!â\\x80\\x99 and she crept up and\\r\\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\\r\\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\\r\\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\\r\\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\\r\\nand cried: â\\x80\\x98Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!â\\x80\\x99 Then Hansel\\r\\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\\r\\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\\r\\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witchâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98These are far better than pebbles!â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, and thrust into his\\r\\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: â\\x80\\x98I, too, will take\\r\\nsomething home with me,â\\x80\\x99 and filled her pinafore full. â\\x80\\x98But now we must\\r\\nbe off,â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, â\\x80\\x98that we may get out of the witchâ\\x80\\x99s forest.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\\r\\nwater. â\\x80\\x98We cannot cross,â\\x80\\x99 said Hansel, â\\x80\\x98I see no foot-plank, and no\\r\\nbridge.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And there is also no ferry,â\\x80\\x99 answered Gretel, â\\x80\\x98but a white\\r\\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.â\\x80\\x99 Then she\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\\r\\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\\r\\n  Thereâ\\x80\\x99s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\\r\\n  Take us across on thy back so white.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\\r\\nhis sister to sit by him. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 replied Gretel, â\\x80\\x98that will be too heavy\\r\\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\\r\\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\\r\\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. Then\\r\\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\\r\\ntheir fatherâ\\x80\\x99s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\\r\\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\\r\\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\\r\\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\\r\\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\\r\\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\\r\\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\\r\\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\\r\\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\\r\\nconsiderably to their stores. The birdâ\\x80\\x99s duty was to fly daily into the\\r\\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\\r\\nto the cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\\r\\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\\r\\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\\r\\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\\r\\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\\r\\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\\r\\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\\r\\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\\r\\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\\r\\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\\r\\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\\r\\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\\r\\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\\r\\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\\r\\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\\r\\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\\r\\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\\r\\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\\r\\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\\r\\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\\r\\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\\r\\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\\r\\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\\r\\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\\r\\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\\r\\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\\r\\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\\r\\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\\r\\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\\r\\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\\r\\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\\r\\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\\r\\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\\r\\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\\r\\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\\r\\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\\r\\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\\r\\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\\r\\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\\r\\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\\r\\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\\r\\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\\r\\nto recover himself, he was drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER HOLLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\\r\\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\\r\\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\\r\\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\\r\\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\\r\\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\\r\\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\\r\\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\\r\\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\\r\\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\\r\\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\\r\\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, â\\x80\\x98As you have let the spindle fall\\r\\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\\r\\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\\r\\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\\r\\nin every direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a bakerâ\\x80\\x99s oven\\r\\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, â\\x80\\x98Take us out, take us\\r\\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\\r\\nago.â\\x80\\x99 So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Shake me, shake me, I pray,â\\x80\\x99 cried the tree; â\\x80\\x98my apples, one and all,\\r\\nare ripe.â\\x80\\x99 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\\r\\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\\r\\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\\r\\nheap and walked on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\\r\\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\\r\\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, â\\x80\\x98What are you\\r\\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\\r\\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\\r\\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\\r\\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\\r\\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.â\\x80\\x99 The old woman\\r\\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\\r\\ninto her service.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took care to do everything according to the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s bidding and\\r\\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\\r\\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\\r\\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\\r\\nboiled meats every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\\r\\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\\r\\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\\r\\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\\r\\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\\r\\nto Mother Holle and said, â\\x80\\x98I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\\r\\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\\r\\npeople.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Mother Holle said, â\\x80\\x98I am pleased that you should want to go back\\r\\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\\r\\nwill take you home myself.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\\r\\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\\r\\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\\r\\nhead to foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is a reward for your industry,â\\x80\\x99 said Mother Holle, and as she\\r\\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\\r\\nworld close to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\\r\\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your golden daughterâ\\x80\\x99s come back to you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\\r\\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\\r\\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\\r\\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\\r\\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\\r\\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\\r\\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\\r\\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\\r\\ntill she came to the oven. â\\x80\\x98Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\\r\\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,â\\x80\\x99 cried the loaves\\r\\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, â\\x80\\x98Do you think I am going to dirty\\r\\nmy hands for you?â\\x80\\x99 and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. â\\x80\\x98Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\\r\\napples, one and all, are ripe,â\\x80\\x99 it cried. But she only answered, â\\x80\\x98A nice\\r\\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\npassed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she came to Mother Holleâ\\x80\\x99s house, and as she had heard all about\\r\\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\\r\\nherself without delay to the old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\\r\\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\\r\\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\\r\\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\\r\\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\\r\\nmake the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\\r\\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\\r\\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\\r\\nthought to herself, â\\x80\\x98The gold will soon be mine.â\\x80\\x99 Mother Holle led her,\\r\\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\\r\\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\\r\\npouring over her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is in return for your services,â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman, and she shut\\r\\nthe gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\\r\\nwell called out as she saw her:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your dirty daughterâ\\x80\\x99s come back to you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\\r\\nher as long as she lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\\r\\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\\r\\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\\r\\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\\r\\nwear anything else; so she was always called â\\x80\\x98Little Red-Cap.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day her mother said to her: â\\x80\\x98Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\\r\\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\\r\\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\\r\\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\\r\\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\\r\\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to say, â\\x80\\x9cGood\\r\\nmorningâ\\x80\\x9d, and donâ\\x80\\x99t peep into every corner before you do it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will take great care,â\\x80\\x99 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\\r\\nher hand on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\\r\\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\\r\\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good day, Little Red-Cap,â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thank you kindly, wolf.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98To my grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What have you got in your apron?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\\r\\nhave something good, to make her stronger.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\\r\\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\\r\\nsurely must know it,â\\x80\\x99 replied Little Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf thought to himself: â\\x80\\x98What a tender young creature! what a nice\\r\\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\\r\\nact craftily, so as to catch both.â\\x80\\x99 So he walked for a short time by\\r\\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: â\\x80\\x98See, Little Red-Cap, how\\r\\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\\r\\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\\r\\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\\r\\nout here in the wood is merry.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\\r\\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\\r\\nshe thought: â\\x80\\x98Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\\r\\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\\r\\nin good timeâ\\x80\\x99; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\\r\\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\\r\\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s house and knocked\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who is there?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Little Red-Cap,â\\x80\\x99 replied the wolf. â\\x80\\x98She is bringing cake and wine; open\\r\\nthe door.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Lift the latch,â\\x80\\x99 called out the grandmother, â\\x80\\x98I am too weak, and cannot\\r\\nget up.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\\r\\nword he went straight to the grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s bed, and devoured her. Then\\r\\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\\r\\nand drew the curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\\r\\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\\r\\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\\r\\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\\r\\nherself: â\\x80\\x98Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\\r\\nbeing with grandmother so much.â\\x80\\x99 She called out: â\\x80\\x98Good morning,â\\x80\\x99 but\\r\\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\\r\\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\\r\\nlooking very strange.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! grandmother,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98what big ears you have!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The better to hear you with, my child,â\\x80\\x99 was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The better to see you with, my dear.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, grandmother, what large hands you have!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The better to hug you with.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The better to eat you with!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\\r\\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\\r\\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\\r\\nthe house, and thought to himself: â\\x80\\x98How the old woman is snoring! I must\\r\\njust see if she wants anything.â\\x80\\x99 So he went into the room, and when he\\r\\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. â\\x80\\x98Do I find you\\r\\nhere, you old sinner!â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98I have long sought you!â\\x80\\x99 Then just as\\r\\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\\r\\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\\r\\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\\r\\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\\r\\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\\r\\nsprang out, crying: â\\x80\\x98Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\\r\\ninside the wolfâ\\x80\\x99; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\\r\\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\\r\\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolfâ\\x80\\x99s belly, and when he awoke,\\r\\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\\r\\nonce, and fell dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolfâ\\x80\\x99s skin and\\r\\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\\r\\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: â\\x80\\x98As\\r\\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\\r\\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\\r\\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\\r\\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\\r\\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\\r\\nhad said â\\x80\\x98good morningâ\\x80\\x99 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\\r\\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\\r\\nhave eaten her up. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the grandmother, â\\x80\\x98we will shut the door,\\r\\nthat he may not come in.â\\x80\\x99 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\\r\\nsome cakes.â\\x80\\x99 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\\r\\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\\r\\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\\r\\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\\r\\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\\r\\ntrough, so she said to the child: â\\x80\\x98Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\\r\\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\\r\\ntrough.â\\x80\\x99 Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\\r\\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\\r\\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\\r\\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\\r\\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\\r\\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\\r\\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\\r\\nfor. He said to himself, â\\x80\\x98I will give her to the first suitable man who\\r\\ncomes and asks for her hand.â\\x80\\x99 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\\r\\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\\r\\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\\r\\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\\r\\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\\r\\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, â\\x80\\x98You\\r\\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\\r\\ntime.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I do not know where your house is,â\\x80\\x99 she answered. â\\x80\\x98My house is\\r\\nout there in the dark forest,â\\x80\\x99 he said. She tried to excuse herself by\\r\\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\\r\\nonly replied, â\\x80\\x98You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\\r\\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\\r\\nwill strew ashes along the path.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\\r\\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\\r\\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\\r\\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\\r\\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\\r\\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\\r\\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\\r\\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\\r\\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\\r\\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\\r\\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderersâ\\x80\\x99 lair.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\\r\\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderersâ\\x80\\x99 lair.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\\r\\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\\r\\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\\r\\nshaking. â\\x80\\x98Can you tell me,â\\x80\\x99 asked the girl, â\\x80\\x98if my betrothed husband\\r\\nlives here?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, you poor child,â\\x80\\x99 answered the old woman, â\\x80\\x98what a place for you to\\r\\ncome to! This is a murderersâ\\x80\\x99 den. You think yourself a promised bride,\\r\\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\\r\\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\\r\\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\\r\\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\\r\\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\\r\\nyou, you would be lost.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\\r\\nfrom view. â\\x80\\x98Keep as still as a mouse,â\\x80\\x99 she said; â\\x80\\x98do not move or speak,\\r\\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\\r\\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\\r\\nopportunity to escape.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\\r\\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\\r\\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\\r\\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\\r\\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\\r\\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\\r\\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\\r\\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\\r\\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\\r\\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\\r\\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\\r\\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\\r\\ncould not find it. â\\x80\\x98Have you looked behind the large cask?â\\x80\\x99 said one of\\r\\nthe others. But the old woman called out, â\\x80\\x98Come and eat your suppers,\\r\\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger wonâ\\x80\\x99t run away.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The old woman is right,â\\x80\\x99 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\\r\\nthe finger and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\\r\\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\\r\\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\\r\\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\\r\\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\\r\\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\\r\\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderersâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\\r\\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\\r\\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\\r\\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\\r\\nall that had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\\r\\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\\r\\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\\r\\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\\r\\nnot say a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you, my love,â\\x80\\x99 said the bridegroom, turning to her, â\\x80\\x98is there no\\r\\ntale you know? Tell us something.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will tell you a dream, then,â\\x80\\x99 said the bride. â\\x80\\x98I went alone through a\\r\\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\\r\\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderersâ\\x80\\x99 lair.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nand again a second time it said these words.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My darling, this is only a dream.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\\r\\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\\r\\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\\r\\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you poor child, you are come to a murderersâ\\x80\\x99 den; your betrothed\\r\\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\\r\\ncook and eat you.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My darling, this is only a dream.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\\r\\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\\r\\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\\r\\nyellow, and with that she died.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My darling, this is only a dream.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My darling, this is only a dream.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\\r\\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\\r\\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\\r\\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.â\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\\r\\nassembled guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\\r\\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\\r\\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\\r\\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTOM THUMB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\\r\\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. â\\x80\\x98How lonely it is,\\r\\nwife,â\\x80\\x99 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, â\\x80\\x98for you and me\\r\\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\\r\\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What you say is very true,â\\x80\\x99 said the wife, sighing, and turning round\\r\\nher wheel; â\\x80\\x98how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\\r\\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\\r\\nhappy, and love it dearly.â\\x80\\x99 Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\\r\\npass that this good womanâ\\x80\\x99s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\\r\\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\\r\\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\\r\\nthey said, â\\x80\\x98Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\\r\\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.â\\x80\\x99 And they called him Thomas\\r\\nThumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\\r\\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\\r\\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\\r\\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\\r\\nfuel, he said, â\\x80\\x98I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\\r\\nwant to make haste.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, father,â\\x80\\x99 cried Tom, â\\x80\\x98I will take care of that;\\r\\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.â\\x80\\x99 Then the woodman\\r\\nlaughed, and said, â\\x80\\x98How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horseâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbridle.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Never mind that, father,â\\x80\\x99 said Tom; â\\x80\\x98if my mother will only\\r\\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\\r\\ngo.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the father, â\\x80\\x98we will try for once.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\\r\\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\\r\\nto go, crying out, â\\x80\\x98Go on!â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Stop!â\\x80\\x99 as he wanted: and thus the horse\\r\\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\\r\\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\\r\\nwas calling out, â\\x80\\x98Gently! gently!â\\x80\\x99 two strangers came up. â\\x80\\x98What an odd\\r\\nthing that is!â\\x80\\x99 said one: â\\x80\\x98there is a cart going along, and I hear a\\r\\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is queer,\\r\\nindeed,â\\x80\\x99 said the other; â\\x80\\x98let us follow the cart, and see where it\\r\\ngoes.â\\x80\\x99 So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\\r\\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x98See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\\r\\nme down!â\\x80\\x99 So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\\r\\nthe other took his son out of the horseâ\\x80\\x99s ear, and put him down upon a\\r\\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\\r\\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, â\\x80\\x98That\\r\\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\\r\\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.â\\x80\\x99 So they went up to\\r\\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. â\\x80\\x98He\\r\\nwill be better off,â\\x80\\x99 said they, â\\x80\\x98with us than with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I wonâ\\x80\\x99t sell\\r\\nhim at all,â\\x80\\x99 said the father; â\\x80\\x98my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\\r\\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.â\\x80\\x99 But Tom, hearing of the\\r\\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s coat to his shoulder\\r\\nand whispered in his ear, â\\x80\\x98Take the money, father, and let them have me;\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll soon come back to you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\\r\\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. â\\x80\\x98Where would you like to\\r\\nsit?â\\x80\\x99 said one of them. â\\x80\\x98Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\\r\\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\\r\\ngo along.â\\x80\\x99 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\\r\\nfather they took him away with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Let me get down, Iâ\\x80\\x99m tired.â\\x80\\x99 So the man took off his hat, and\\r\\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\\r\\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\\r\\nan old mouse-hole. â\\x80\\x98Good night, my masters!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m off! mind and\\r\\nlook sharp after me the next time.â\\x80\\x99 Then they ran at once to the place,\\r\\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\\r\\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\\r\\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\\r\\nsulky as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. â\\x80\\x98What\\r\\ndangerous walking it is,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98in this ploughed field! If I were to\\r\\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. â\\x80\\x98This is\\r\\nlucky,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I can sleep here very wellâ\\x80\\x99; and in he crept.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\\r\\ntogether; and one said to the other, â\\x80\\x98How can we rob that rich parsonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse of his silver and gold?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you!â\\x80\\x99 cried Tom. â\\x80\\x98What noise\\r\\nwas that?â\\x80\\x99 said the thief, frightened; â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I heard someone speak.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, â\\x80\\x98Take me with you, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nsoon show you how to get the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s money.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But where are you?â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthey. â\\x80\\x98Look about on the ground,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98and listen where the\\r\\nsound comes from.â\\x80\\x99 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\\r\\nup in their hands. â\\x80\\x98You little urchin!â\\x80\\x99 they said, â\\x80\\x98what can you do for\\r\\nus?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s house,\\r\\nand throw you out whatever you want.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a good thought,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nthieves; â\\x80\\x98come along, we shall see what you can do.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s house, Tom slipped through the\\r\\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Will you have all that is here?â\\x80\\x99 At this the thieves were frightened,\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?â\\x80\\x99 Now the cook lay in\\r\\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\\r\\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\\r\\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, â\\x80\\x98The little\\r\\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.â\\x80\\x99 So they came back and\\r\\nwhispered softly to him, saying, â\\x80\\x98Now let us have no more of your\\r\\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.â\\x80\\x99 Then Tom called out\\r\\nas loud as he could, â\\x80\\x98Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\\r\\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\\r\\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\\r\\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\\r\\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\\r\\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\\r\\neyes open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\\r\\nplace to finish his nightâ\\x80\\x99s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\\r\\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\\r\\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\\r\\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\\r\\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\\r\\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\\r\\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\\r\\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\\r\\ncowâ\\x80\\x99s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. â\\x80\\x98Good\\r\\nlack-a-day!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98how came I to tumble into the mill?â\\x80\\x99 But he soon\\r\\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\\r\\nhim, that he might not get between the cowâ\\x80\\x99s teeth, and so be crushed to\\r\\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. â\\x80\\x98It is rather dark,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nhe; â\\x80\\x98they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\\r\\ncandle would be no bad thing.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\\r\\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\\r\\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\\r\\ncried out as loud as he could, â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t bring me any more hay! Donâ\\x80\\x99t bring\\r\\nme any more hay!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\\r\\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\\r\\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\\r\\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\\r\\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\\r\\nparson, and said, â\\x80\\x98Sir, sir, the cow is talking!â\\x80\\x99 But the parson\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Woman, thou art surely mad!â\\x80\\x99 However, he went with her into the\\r\\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbring me any more hay!â\\x80\\x99 Then the parson himself was frightened; and\\r\\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\\r\\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\\r\\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\\r\\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\\r\\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\\r\\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\\r\\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x98My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Whereâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the wolf. â\\x80\\x98In such and such a house,â\\x80\\x99 said Tom, describing his own\\r\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. â\\x80\\x98You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\\r\\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\\r\\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\\r\\nwish.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\\r\\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\\r\\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heartâ\\x80\\x99s content. As soon as\\r\\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\\r\\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\\r\\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. â\\x80\\x98Will you be easy?â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nwolf; â\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s that to me?â\\x80\\x99 said the little man; â\\x80\\x98you have had your frolic, now\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve a mind to be merry myselfâ\\x80\\x99; and he began, singing and shouting as\\r\\nloud as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\\r\\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\\r\\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\\r\\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. â\\x80\\x98Do you stay behind,â\\x80\\x99 said the woodman,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\\r\\nscythe.â\\x80\\x99 Tom heard all this, and cried out, â\\x80\\x98Father, father! I am here,\\r\\nthe wolf has swallowed me.â\\x80\\x99 And his father said, â\\x80\\x98Heaven be praised! we\\r\\nhave found our dear child againâ\\x80\\x99; and he told his wife not to use the\\r\\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\\r\\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\\r\\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the father,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98what fears we have had for you!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, father,â\\x80\\x99 answered he; â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\\r\\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, where have you been?â\\x80\\x99 said his father. â\\x80\\x98I have been in a\\r\\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cowâ\\x80\\x99s throat--and in the\\r\\nwolfâ\\x80\\x99s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said they, â\\x80\\x98you are come back, and we will not sell you again\\r\\nfor all the riches in the world.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\\r\\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\\r\\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\\r\\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\\r\\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\\r\\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\\r\\nagreed that, after all, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no place like HOME!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\\r\\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The millerâ\\x80\\x99s house was\\r\\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\\r\\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\\r\\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\\r\\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\\r\\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the millerâ\\x80\\x99s boast\\r\\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\\r\\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\\r\\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, â\\x80\\x98All this must\\r\\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.â\\x80\\x99 It was in vain\\r\\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\\r\\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\\r\\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\\r\\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\\r\\nhobbled in, and said, â\\x80\\x98Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\\r\\nweeping for?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I must spin this straw into gold, and\\r\\nI know not how.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What will you give me,â\\x80\\x99 said the hobgoblin, â\\x80\\x98to do it\\r\\nfor you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98My necklace,â\\x80\\x99 replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\\r\\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\\r\\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\\r\\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\\r\\nmillerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\\r\\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98What will you give me to do your task?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The ring on my finger,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\\r\\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\\r\\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the millerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter to a yet\\r\\nlarger heap, and said, â\\x80\\x98All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\\r\\nyou shall be my queen.â\\x80\\x99 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have nothing left,â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98Then say you will give me,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe little man, â\\x80\\x98the first little child that you may have when you are\\r\\nqueen.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That may never be,â\\x80\\x99 thought the millerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter: and as she\\r\\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\\r\\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\\r\\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\\r\\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the millerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\\r\\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\\r\\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\\r\\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\\r\\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\\r\\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, â\\x80\\x98I will give you three daysâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\\r\\nchild.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\\r\\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\\r\\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\\r\\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\\r\\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, â\\x80\\x98Madam, that is not my\\r\\nname.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\\r\\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\\r\\nstill said to every one of them, â\\x80\\x98Madam, that is not my name.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\\r\\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\\r\\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\\r\\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\\r\\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x9cMerrily the feast Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make.\\r\\n  Today Iâ\\x80\\x99ll brew, tomorrow bake;\\r\\n  Merrily Iâ\\x80\\x99ll dance and sing,\\r\\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\\r\\n  Little does my lady dream\\r\\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\\r\\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\\r\\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\\r\\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\\r\\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\\r\\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, â\\x80\\x98Now, lady, what is my\\r\\nname?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Is it JOHN?â\\x80\\x99 asked she. â\\x80\\x98No, madam!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Is it TOM?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, madam!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is it JEMMY?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nlady slyly. â\\x80\\x98Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!â\\x80\\x99 cried\\r\\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\\r\\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\\r\\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\\r\\ntrouble for nothing, and said, â\\x80\\x98We wish you a very good morning, and a\\r\\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\\r\\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\\r\\nwas quite happy and thought: â\\x80\\x98You certainly are a pretty girl!â\\x80\\x99 And when\\r\\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\\r\\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\\r\\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: â\\x80\\x98The cook must know what\\r\\nthe food is like.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: â\\x80\\x98Gretel, there is a\\r\\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I will\\r\\nsee to it, master,â\\x80\\x99 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\\r\\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\\r\\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\\r\\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\\r\\nto her master: â\\x80\\x98If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\\r\\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\\r\\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.â\\x80\\x99 The master said: â\\x80\\x98I will run\\r\\nmyself, and fetch the guest.â\\x80\\x99 When the master had turned his back,\\r\\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: â\\x80\\x98Standing\\r\\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\\r\\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\\r\\ndrink.â\\x80\\x99 She ran down, set a jug, said: â\\x80\\x98God bless it for you, Gretel,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\\r\\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\\r\\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\\r\\nGretel thought: â\\x80\\x98Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: â\\x80\\x98Ah! how good fowls are! It\\r\\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\\r\\ntime!â\\x80\\x99 She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\\r\\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\\r\\nthought: â\\x80\\x98The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\\r\\nsomething is missing.â\\x80\\x99 When the two wings were eaten, she went and\\r\\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\\r\\nher: â\\x80\\x98Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\\r\\nsomewhere.â\\x80\\x99 Then she said: â\\x80\\x98Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\\r\\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\\r\\neaten you will have some peace, why should Godâ\\x80\\x99s good gifts be spoilt?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\\r\\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\\r\\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\\r\\nanother draught it would do me no harm.â\\x80\\x99 So she took another hearty\\r\\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: â\\x80\\x98Hurry\\r\\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, sir, I will\\r\\nsoon serve up,â\\x80\\x99 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\\r\\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\\r\\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\\r\\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\\r\\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\\r\\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: â\\x80\\x98Hush! hush! go away as quickly\\r\\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\\r\\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\\r\\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!â\\x80\\x99 The guest\\r\\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\\r\\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You have invited a fine guest!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98he has taken the chickens which I was just\\r\\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nnice trick!â\\x80\\x99 said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. â\\x80\\x98If he had\\r\\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.â\\x80\\x99 He called to\\r\\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\\r\\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: â\\x80\\x98Just one, just one,â\\x80\\x99 meaning\\r\\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\\r\\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\\r\\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\\r\\nthem both with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\\r\\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\\r\\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\\r\\nout of his mouth. His son and his sonâ\\x80\\x99s wife were disgusted at this, so\\r\\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\\r\\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\\r\\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\\r\\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\\r\\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\\r\\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\\r\\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\\r\\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. â\\x80\\x98What are\\r\\nyou doing there?â\\x80\\x99 asked the father. â\\x80\\x98I am making a little trough,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nanswered the child, â\\x80\\x98for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\\r\\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\\r\\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\\r\\ndid spill a little of anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\\r\\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\\r\\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\\r\\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\\r\\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\\r\\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.â\\x80\\x99 the woman\\r\\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\\r\\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\\r\\nhanging down as if it were eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\\r\\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: â\\x80\\x98Look, I have a little calf there,\\r\\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.â\\x80\\x99 The cow-herd said: â\\x80\\x98All\\r\\nright,â\\x80\\x99 and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\\r\\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\\r\\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: â\\x80\\x98It will soon run by itself,\\r\\njust look how it eats already!â\\x80\\x99 At night when he was going to drive the\\r\\nherd home again, he said to the calf: â\\x80\\x98If you can stand there and eat\\r\\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I donâ\\x80\\x99t care to drag you\\r\\nhome again in my arms.â\\x80\\x99 But the little peasant stood at his door, and\\r\\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\\r\\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\\r\\ncow-herd answered: â\\x80\\x98It is still standing out there eating. It would not\\r\\nstop and come with us.â\\x80\\x99 But the little peasant said: â\\x80\\x98Oh, but I must\\r\\nhave my beast back again.â\\x80\\x99 Then they went back to the meadow together,\\r\\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: â\\x80\\x98It\\r\\nmust have run away.â\\x80\\x99 The peasant, however, said: â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me\\r\\nthat,â\\x80\\x99 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\\r\\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\\r\\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\\r\\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\\r\\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\\r\\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\\r\\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\\r\\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\\r\\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\\r\\nmillerâ\\x80\\x99s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: â\\x80\\x98Lay\\r\\nyourself on the straw there,â\\x80\\x99 and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\\r\\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\\r\\nthought: â\\x80\\x98He is tired and has gone to sleep.â\\x80\\x99 In the meantime came the\\r\\nparson; the millerâ\\x80\\x99s wife received him well, and said: â\\x80\\x98My husband is\\r\\nout, so we will have a feast.â\\x80\\x99 The peasant listened, and when he heard\\r\\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\\r\\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\\r\\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\\r\\noutside. The woman said: â\\x80\\x98Oh, heavens! It is my husband!â\\x80\\x99 she quickly\\r\\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\\r\\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\\r\\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: â\\x80\\x98Thank\\r\\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\\r\\nworld were coming to an end.â\\x80\\x99 The miller saw the peasant lying on the\\r\\nstraw, and asked, â\\x80\\x98What is that fellow doing there?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nwife, â\\x80\\x98the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\\r\\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\\r\\nthe straw was.â\\x80\\x99 The man said: â\\x80\\x98I have no objection, but be quick and get\\r\\nme something to eat.â\\x80\\x99 The woman said: â\\x80\\x98But I have nothing but bread and\\r\\ncheese.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am contented with anything,â\\x80\\x99 replied the husband, â\\x80\\x98so far as\\r\\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,â\\x80\\x99 and looked at the peasant and\\r\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98Come and eat some more with me.â\\x80\\x99 The peasant did not require to\\r\\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\\r\\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: â\\x80\\x98What have you\\r\\nthere?â\\x80\\x99 The peasant answered: â\\x80\\x98I have a soothsayer inside it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Can\\r\\nhe foretell anything to me?â\\x80\\x99 said the miller. â\\x80\\x98Why not?â\\x80\\x99 answered\\r\\nthe peasant: â\\x80\\x98but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\\r\\nhimself.â\\x80\\x99 The miller was curious, and said: â\\x80\\x98Let him foretell something\\r\\nfor once.â\\x80\\x99 Then the peasant pinched the ravenâ\\x80\\x99s head, so that he croaked\\r\\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: â\\x80\\x98What did he say?â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\npeasant answered: â\\x80\\x98In the first place, he says that there is some wine\\r\\nhidden under the pillow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Bless me!â\\x80\\x99 cried the miller, and went there\\r\\nand found the wine. â\\x80\\x98Now go on,â\\x80\\x99 said he. The peasant made the raven\\r\\ncroak again, and said: â\\x80\\x98In the second place, he says that there is some\\r\\nroast meat in the tiled stove.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Upon my word!â\\x80\\x99 cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\\r\\nprophesy still more, and said: â\\x80\\x98Thirdly, he says that there is some\\r\\nsalad on the bed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That would be a fine thing!â\\x80\\x99 cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\\r\\nonce more till he croaked, and said: â\\x80\\x98Fourthly, he says that there\\r\\nare some cakes under the bed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That would be a fine thing!â\\x80\\x99 cried the\\r\\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the millerâ\\x80\\x99s wife\\r\\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\\r\\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\\r\\npeasant said: â\\x80\\x98First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\\r\\nis something bad.â\\x80\\x99 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\\r\\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\\r\\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the ravenâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: â\\x80\\x98What did he say?â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\npeasant replied: â\\x80\\x98He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\\r\\nthe closet on the porch.â\\x80\\x99 The miller said: â\\x80\\x98The Devil must go out,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\\r\\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\\r\\ncould, and the miller said: â\\x80\\x98It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\\r\\nown eyes.â\\x80\\x99 The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\\r\\nthe three hundred talers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\\r\\nhouse, and the peasants said: â\\x80\\x98The small peasant has certainly been to\\r\\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\\r\\nshovels.â\\x80\\x99 Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\\r\\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: â\\x80\\x98I sold my cowâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.â\\x80\\x99 When the peasants heard\\r\\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\\r\\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\\r\\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: â\\x80\\x98But my\\r\\nservant must go first.â\\x80\\x99 When she came to the merchant in the town, he\\r\\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\\r\\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: â\\x80\\x98What can I do with all\\r\\nthese skins?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\\r\\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\\r\\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\\r\\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\\r\\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\\r\\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\\r\\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\\r\\nman who had been with the millerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. He said to him: â\\x80\\x98I set you free\\r\\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.â\\x80\\x99 At this same moment up\\r\\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\\r\\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: â\\x80\\x98No, I\\r\\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: â\\x80\\x98What are you about?\\r\\nWhat is it that you will not do?â\\x80\\x99 The peasant said: â\\x80\\x98They want to make\\r\\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe shepherd said: â\\x80\\x98If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\\r\\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.â\\x80\\x99 The peasant said: â\\x80\\x98If you\\r\\nwill get in, you will be mayor.â\\x80\\x99 The shepherd was willing, and got in,\\r\\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\\r\\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\\r\\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\\r\\ncried: â\\x80\\x98I am quite willing to be mayor.â\\x80\\x99 They believed no otherwise than\\r\\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: â\\x80\\x98That is\\r\\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\\r\\nthere,â\\x80\\x99 and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\\r\\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\\r\\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\\r\\nwater?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, truly,â\\x80\\x99 replied the peasant, â\\x80\\x98I sank deep, deep down,\\r\\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\\r\\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\\r\\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x99 Said the peasants: â\\x80\\x98Are there any more there?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98more than I could want.â\\x80\\x99 Then the peasants made up their minds that\\r\\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\\r\\nmayor said: â\\x80\\x98I come first.â\\x80\\x99 So they went to the water together, and just\\r\\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\\r\\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\\r\\nthe peasants cried: â\\x80\\x98We already see the sheep down below!â\\x80\\x99 The mayor\\r\\npressed forward and said: â\\x80\\x98I will go down first, and look about me, and\\r\\nif things promise well Iâ\\x80\\x99ll call you.â\\x80\\x99 So he jumped in; splash! went\\r\\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\\r\\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\\r\\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\\r\\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\\r\\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98it shall all be ready.â\\x80\\x99 When dinner-time drew\\r\\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\\r\\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\\r\\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\\r\\nthen she said to herself, â\\x80\\x98The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\\r\\nto the cellar for the ale.â\\x80\\x99 So she left the pan on the fire and took a\\r\\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\\r\\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\\r\\nhead, â\\x80\\x98The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s well thought of.â\\x80\\x99 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\\r\\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\\r\\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s all gone, and â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t be cured must be enduredâ\\x80\\x9d,â\\x80\\x99 said Catherine. So she turned round;\\r\\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\\r\\nto cool herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\\r\\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\\r\\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\\r\\nhappened. â\\x80\\x98My stars!â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98what shall I do to keep Frederick from\\r\\nseeing all this slopping about?â\\x80\\x99 So she thought a while; and at last\\r\\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\\r\\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\\r\\nnicely. â\\x80\\x98What a lucky thing,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98that we kept that meal! we have\\r\\nnow a good use for it.â\\x80\\x99 So away she went for it: but she managed to set\\r\\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\\r\\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. â\\x80\\x98Ah!\\r\\nwell,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98when one goes another may as well follow.â\\x80\\x99 Then she\\r\\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\\r\\ncleverness, and said, â\\x80\\x98How very neat and clean it looks!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon Frederick came home. â\\x80\\x98Now, wife,â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98what have you for\\r\\ndinner?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98O Frederick!â\\x80\\x99 answered she, â\\x80\\x98I was cooking you a steak; but\\r\\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\\r\\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\\r\\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\\r\\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Kate, Kate,â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98how could you do all this?â\\x80\\x99 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\\r\\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why, Frederick,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98If my wife manages matters thus, I must\\r\\nlook sharp myself.â\\x80\\x99 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\\r\\nsaid to Catherine, â\\x80\\x98What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\\r\\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\\r\\nnever go near or meddle with them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, Frederick,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98that\\r\\nI never will.â\\x80\\x99 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\\r\\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\\r\\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yellow\\r\\nbuttons!â\\x80\\x99 said they: â\\x80\\x98let us have a look at them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go into the garden\\r\\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\\r\\nnot go myself.â\\x80\\x99 So the rogues went: and when they found what these\\r\\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\\r\\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\\r\\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, â\\x80\\x98Kate, what have you been\\r\\ndoing?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98See,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98I have bought all these with your yellow\\r\\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\\r\\nand dug them up.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Wife, wife,â\\x80\\x99 said Frederick, â\\x80\\x98what a pretty piece of\\r\\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\\r\\nto do such a thing?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why,â\\x80\\x99 answered she, â\\x80\\x98I did not know there was any\\r\\nharm in it; you should have told me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\\r\\nthe thieves.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, we will try,â\\x80\\x99 answered he; â\\x80\\x98but take some butter\\r\\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\\r\\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. â\\x80\\x98It does not matter,â\\x80\\x99 thought\\r\\nshe: â\\x80\\x98when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\\r\\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\\r\\non each side as they passed. â\\x80\\x98Ah, see now,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98how they have\\r\\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.â\\x80\\x99 So she\\r\\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\\r\\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\\r\\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\\r\\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\\r\\nhas younger legs than I have.â\\x80\\x99 Then she rolled the other cheese after\\r\\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\\r\\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\\r\\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\\r\\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. â\\x80\\x98Where are the butter and cheese?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid he. â\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 answered she, â\\x80\\x98I used the butter to grease those poor\\r\\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\\r\\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\\r\\nthe road together somewhere.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What a goose you are to do such silly\\r\\nthings!â\\x80\\x99 said the husband. â\\x80\\x98How can you say so?â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98I am sure\\r\\nyou never told me not.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, â\\x80\\x98Kate, I hope you\\r\\nlocked the door safe when you came away.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 answered she, â\\x80\\x98you did\\r\\nnot tell me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid Frederick, â\\x80\\x98and bring with you something to eat.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Frederick wants something to eat; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he is very fond of\\r\\nbutter and cheese: Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\\r\\nfor I have often seen him take some.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\\r\\ntook off the hinges, and said, â\\x80\\x98Frederick told me to lock the door, but\\r\\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.â\\x80\\x99 So she took\\r\\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x98There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\\r\\ncarefully as you please.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas! alas!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98what a clever wife I\\r\\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\\r\\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\\r\\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 answered she, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll carry the door; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not carry the\\r\\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\\r\\nyou please, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll fasten them to the door.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\\r\\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\\r\\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\\r\\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\\r\\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\\r\\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\\r\\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\\r\\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\\r\\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\\r\\nthe head with them: but they only said, â\\x80\\x98It must be near morning, for\\r\\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\\r\\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\\r\\nsoftly, â\\x80\\x98Frederick, I must let the nuts go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98not\\r\\nnow, they will discover us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t help that: they must go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,\\r\\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.â\\x80\\x99 Then away rattled\\r\\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, â\\x80\\x98Bless me,\\r\\nit is hailing.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\\r\\nso she whispered to Frederick, â\\x80\\x98I must throw the vinegar down.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Pray\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98it will discover us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t help that,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nshe, â\\x80\\x98go it must.â\\x80\\x99 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98What a heavy dew there is!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it popped into Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s head that it was the door itself that\\r\\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, â\\x80\\x98Frederick, I must throw\\r\\nthe door down soon.â\\x80\\x99 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\\r\\nwas sure it would betray them. â\\x80\\x98Here goes, however,â\\x80\\x99 said she: and down\\r\\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\\r\\nout â\\x80\\x98Murder!â\\x80\\x99 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\\r\\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\\r\\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\\r\\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\\r\\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\\r\\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\\r\\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\\r\\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. â\\x80\\x98Be quiet, my\\r\\nchild,â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman, â\\x80\\x98and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\\r\\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\\r\\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\\r\\npush her well to the front.â\\x80\\x99 It would have been all over with the poor\\r\\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\\r\\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\\r\\nhad come, the witchâ\\x80\\x99s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\\r\\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\\r\\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\\r\\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\\r\\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\\r\\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own childâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead off.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\\r\\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\\r\\nto him: â\\x80\\x98Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\\r\\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\\r\\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But,â\\x80\\x99 said Roland,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\\r\\nif she pursues us.â\\x80\\x99 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\\r\\ndead girlâ\\x80\\x99s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\\r\\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\\r\\nhurried away with her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\\r\\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\\r\\ncried: â\\x80\\x98Where are you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,â\\x80\\x99 answered\\r\\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\\r\\nstairs, and cried again: â\\x80\\x98Where are you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Here in the kitchen, I am\\r\\nwarming myself,â\\x80\\x99 cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\\r\\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: â\\x80\\x98Where are you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\r\\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,â\\x80\\x99 cried the third drop of blood. She went\\r\\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\\r\\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\\r\\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\\r\\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\\r\\nsweetheart Roland. â\\x80\\x98That shall not help you,â\\x80\\x99 cried she, â\\x80\\x98even if you\\r\\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.â\\x80\\x99 She put on her\\r\\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hourâ\\x80\\x99s walk at every step,\\r\\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\\r\\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\\r\\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\\r\\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\\r\\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\\r\\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\\r\\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\\r\\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\\r\\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\\r\\ntowards them, and said to the musician: â\\x80\\x98Dear musician, may I pluck that\\r\\nbeautiful flower for myself?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes,â\\x80\\x99 he replied, â\\x80\\x98I will play to\\r\\nyou while you do it.â\\x80\\x99 As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\\r\\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\\r\\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\\r\\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\\r\\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\\r\\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\\r\\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: â\\x80\\x98Now I will go to my father and\\r\\narrange for the wedding.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then in the meantime I will stay here and\\r\\nwait for you,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, â\\x80\\x98and that no one may recognize me, I will\\r\\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.â\\x80\\x99 Then Roland went away, and the\\r\\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\\r\\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\\r\\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\\r\\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\\r\\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: â\\x80\\x98Someone will surely come\\r\\nthis way, and trample me down.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\\r\\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\\r\\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\\r\\nin the shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\\r\\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\\r\\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\\r\\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\\r\\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\\r\\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\\r\\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\\r\\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\\r\\nwoman said: â\\x80\\x98There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\\r\\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\\r\\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\\r\\nbe stopped.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\\r\\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\\r\\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\\r\\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\\r\\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\\r\\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\\r\\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\\r\\nanswered: â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\\r\\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the time drew near when Rolandâ\\x80\\x99s wedding was to be celebrated,\\r\\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\\r\\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\\r\\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\\r\\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\\r\\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\\r\\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\\r\\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Rolandâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nears, he sprang up and cried: â\\x80\\x98I know the voice, that is the true\\r\\nbride, I will have no other!â\\x80\\x99 Everything he had forgotten, and which had\\r\\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\\r\\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\\r\\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOWDROP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\\r\\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\\r\\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\\r\\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\\r\\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\\r\\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, â\\x80\\x98Would that my little\\r\\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\\r\\nblack as this ebony windowframe!â\\x80\\x99 And so the little girl really did grow\\r\\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\\r\\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\\r\\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\\r\\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\\r\\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\\r\\nherself in it, and say:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass had always answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\\r\\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\\r\\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\\r\\nas usual:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\\r\\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\\r\\none of her servants, and said, â\\x80\\x98Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\\r\\nthat I may never see her any more.â\\x80\\x99 Then the servant led her away; but\\r\\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.â\\x80\\x99 So he left her by\\r\\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\\r\\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\\r\\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\\r\\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\\r\\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\\r\\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\\r\\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\\r\\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\\r\\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\\r\\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\\r\\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\\r\\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\\r\\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\\r\\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\\r\\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\\r\\ndown and went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\\r\\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\\r\\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\\r\\nright. The first said, â\\x80\\x98Who has been sitting on my stool?â\\x80\\x99 The second,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who has been eating off my plate?â\\x80\\x99 The third, â\\x80\\x98Who has been picking my\\r\\nbread?â\\x80\\x99 The fourth, â\\x80\\x98Who has been meddling with my spoon?â\\x80\\x99 The fifth,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who has been handling my fork?â\\x80\\x99 The sixth, â\\x80\\x98Who has been cutting with\\r\\nmy knife?â\\x80\\x99 The seventh, â\\x80\\x98Who has been drinking my wine?â\\x80\\x99 Then the first\\r\\nlooked round and said, â\\x80\\x98Who has been lying on my bed?â\\x80\\x99 And the rest came\\r\\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\\r\\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\\r\\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\\r\\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, â\\x80\\x98Good heavens! what a lovely child\\r\\nshe is!â\\x80\\x99 And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\\r\\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\\r\\nin turn, till the night was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\\r\\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\\r\\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\\r\\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\\r\\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\\r\\nhome; and they warned her, and said, â\\x80\\x98The queen will soon find out where\\r\\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\\r\\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\\r\\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\\r\\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\\r\\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\\r\\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\\r\\nknocked at the door, and cried, â\\x80\\x98Fine wares to sell!â\\x80\\x99 Snowdrop looked\\r\\nout at the window, and said, â\\x80\\x98Good day, good woman! what have you to\\r\\nsell?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Good wares, fine wares,â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98laces and bobbins of all\\r\\ncolours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\\r\\nsort of body,â\\x80\\x99 thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bless me!â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman, â\\x80\\x98how badly your stays are laced! Let me\\r\\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.â\\x80\\x99 Snowdrop did not dream of\\r\\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\\r\\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdropâ\\x80\\x99s breath was\\r\\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. â\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s an end to all\\r\\nthy beauty,â\\x80\\x99 said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\\r\\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\\r\\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\\r\\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\\r\\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, â\\x80\\x98The\\r\\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\\r\\nin when we are away.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\\r\\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\\r\\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\\r\\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\\r\\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfsâ\\x80\\x99 cottage, she knocked at the door, and\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x98Fine wares to sell!â\\x80\\x99 But Snowdrop said, â\\x80\\x98I dare not let anyone\\r\\nin.â\\x80\\x99 Then the queen said, â\\x80\\x98Only look at my beautiful combs!â\\x80\\x99 and gave\\r\\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\\r\\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\\r\\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. â\\x80\\x98There you may\\r\\nlie,â\\x80\\x99 said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\\r\\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\\r\\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\\r\\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\\r\\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\\r\\nanyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\\r\\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, â\\x80\\x98Snowdrop shall die,\\r\\nif it cost me my life.â\\x80\\x99 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\\r\\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\\r\\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\\r\\npeasantâ\\x80\\x99s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfsâ\\x80\\x99 cottage,\\r\\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Do\\r\\nas you please,â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman, â\\x80\\x98but at any rate take this pretty\\r\\napple; I will give it you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Snowdrop, â\\x80\\x98I dare not take it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You silly girl!â\\x80\\x99 answered the other, â\\x80\\x98what are you afraid of? Do you\\r\\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\\r\\nother.â\\x80\\x99 Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\\r\\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\\r\\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\\r\\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\\r\\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. â\\x80\\x98This time nothing will save\\r\\nthee,â\\x80\\x99 said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\\r\\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\\r\\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\\r\\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\\r\\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\\r\\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\\r\\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\\r\\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, â\\x80\\x98We will never bury her in\\r\\nthe cold ground.â\\x80\\x99 And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\\r\\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\\r\\nwas, and that she was a kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. And the coffin was set among\\r\\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\\r\\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\\r\\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\\r\\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\\r\\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\\r\\ndwarfsâ\\x80\\x99 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\\r\\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\\r\\nto let him take her away; but they said, â\\x80\\x98We will not part with her for\\r\\nall the gold in the world.â\\x80\\x99 At last, however, they had pity on him, and\\r\\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\\r\\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\\r\\nawoke, and said, â\\x80\\x98Where am I?â\\x80\\x99 And the prince said, â\\x80\\x98Thou art quite safe\\r\\nwith me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, â\\x80\\x98I love you far better\\r\\nthan all the world; so come with me to my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s palace, and you shall\\r\\nbe my wife.â\\x80\\x99 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\\r\\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\\r\\nwedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdropâ\\x80\\x99s old enemy the queen;\\r\\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\\r\\nglass and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\\r\\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\\r\\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\\r\\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\\r\\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\\r\\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\\r\\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\\r\\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\\r\\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PINK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\\r\\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\\r\\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\\r\\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\\r\\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\\r\\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\\r\\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\\r\\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\\r\\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\\r\\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queenâ\\x80\\x99s apron\\r\\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\\r\\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\\r\\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\\r\\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\\r\\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\\r\\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\\r\\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\\r\\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\\r\\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\\r\\nfood until the seven years were over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: â\\x80\\x98If the child has the power of\\r\\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.â\\x80\\x99 So\\r\\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\\r\\nspeak, and said to him: â\\x80\\x98Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\\r\\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.â\\x80\\x99 Scarcely were the words out\\r\\nof the boyâ\\x80\\x99s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\\r\\nAfter a while the cook said to him: â\\x80\\x98It is not well for you to be so\\r\\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.â\\x80\\x99 Then the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son\\r\\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\\r\\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\\r\\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\\r\\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\\r\\nthat the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\\r\\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\\r\\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\\r\\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.â\\x80\\x99 Thereupon he went away, and when\\r\\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: â\\x80\\x98Why should I shed\\r\\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?â\\x80\\x99 The cook once\\r\\nmore said: â\\x80\\x98If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\\r\\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\\r\\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: â\\x80\\x98Lie down in\\r\\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.â\\x80\\x99 Then the wicked wretch came in\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Where are the boyâ\\x80\\x99s heart and tongue?â\\x80\\x99 The girl reached the\\r\\nplate to him, but the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son threw off the quilt, and said: â\\x80\\x98You old\\r\\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\\r\\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\\r\\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\\r\\nthroat.â\\x80\\x99 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\\r\\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\\r\\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\\r\\nflames broke forth from his throat. The kingâ\\x80\\x99s son remained there a\\r\\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\\r\\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: â\\x80\\x98I will go home to my\\r\\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nshe replied, â\\x80\\x98the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\\r\\nwhere I am unknown?â\\x80\\x99 As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\\r\\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\\r\\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\\r\\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\\r\\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\\r\\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\\r\\nlooked inside, and cried: â\\x80\\x98Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\\r\\nalive, or are you dead?â\\x80\\x99 She answered: â\\x80\\x98I have just eaten, and am still\\r\\nsatisfied,â\\x80\\x99 for she thought the angels were there. Said he: â\\x80\\x98I am your\\r\\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\\r\\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.â\\x80\\x99 Then he descended\\r\\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\\r\\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\\r\\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\\r\\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\\r\\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\\r\\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\\r\\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\\r\\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\\r\\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\\r\\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\\r\\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\\r\\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\\r\\nhad none at all for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\\r\\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\\r\\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: â\\x80\\x98As you are\\r\\nso clever, you shall sit by me.â\\x80\\x99 He replied: â\\x80\\x98Lord King, your majesty\\r\\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.â\\x80\\x99 But the king insisted on it,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98You shall sit by me,â\\x80\\x99 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\\r\\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\\r\\nkingâ\\x80\\x99s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\\r\\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\\r\\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\\r\\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?â\\x80\\x99 But the king\\r\\nreplied: â\\x80\\x98She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\\r\\nnot have her named.â\\x80\\x99 Then the huntsman arose and said: â\\x80\\x98Gracious lord\\r\\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\\r\\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\\r\\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\\r\\nchicken.â\\x80\\x99 Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is the wretch!â\\x80\\x99 and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\\r\\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\\r\\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\\r\\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\\r\\nof the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\\r\\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\\r\\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\\r\\nspoke further and said: â\\x80\\x98Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\\r\\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\\r\\nthough her own life depended on it?â\\x80\\x99 The king replied: â\\x80\\x98Yes, I would\\r\\nlike to see her.â\\x80\\x99 The son said: â\\x80\\x98Most gracious father, I will show her\\r\\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,â\\x80\\x99 and he thrust his hand into\\r\\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\\r\\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\\r\\nThen the son said: â\\x80\\x98Now will I show her to you in her own form,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\\r\\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\\r\\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\\r\\nled in she ate nothing, and said: â\\x80\\x98The gracious and merciful God who has\\r\\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.â\\x80\\x99 She lived three days\\r\\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\\r\\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\\r\\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\\r\\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\\r\\nkingâ\\x80\\x99s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\\r\\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\\r\\nare still alive or not, is known to God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER ELSIE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\\r\\nwhen she had grown up her father said: â\\x80\\x98We will get her married.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the mother, â\\x80\\x98if only someone would come who would have her.â\\x80\\x99 At\\r\\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\\r\\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. â\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe father, â\\x80\\x98she has plenty of good senseâ\\x80\\x99; and the mother said: â\\x80\\x98Oh,\\r\\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Hans, â\\x80\\x98if she is not really smart, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have her.â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: â\\x80\\x98Elsie, go\\r\\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.â\\x80\\x99 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\\r\\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\\r\\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\\r\\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\\r\\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\\r\\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\\r\\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\\r\\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\\r\\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: â\\x80\\x98If I get Hans, and we have\\r\\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\\r\\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.â\\x80\\x99 Then she\\r\\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\\r\\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\\r\\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.â\\x80\\x99 The maid went and\\r\\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. â\\x80\\x98Elsie why\\r\\ndo you weep?â\\x80\\x99 asked the maid. â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 she answered, â\\x80\\x98have I not reason to\\r\\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\\r\\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\\r\\nhim.â\\x80\\x99 Then said the maid: â\\x80\\x98What a clever Elsie we have!â\\x80\\x99 and sat down\\r\\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\\r\\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\\r\\nbeer, the man said to the boy: â\\x80\\x98Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.â\\x80\\x99 The boy went down, and there sat Clever\\r\\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: â\\x80\\x98Why are you\\r\\nweeping?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, â\\x80\\x98have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\\r\\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\\r\\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.â\\x80\\x99 Then said the boy: â\\x80\\x98What\\r\\na clever Elsie we have!â\\x80\\x99 and sat down by her, and likewise began to\\r\\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\\r\\nreturn, the man said to the woman: â\\x80\\x98Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie is!â\\x80\\x99 The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\\r\\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\\r\\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\\r\\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\\r\\nmother likewise: â\\x80\\x98What a clever Elsie we have!â\\x80\\x99 and sat down and wept\\r\\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\\r\\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: â\\x80\\x98I must go into the\\r\\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.â\\x80\\x99 But when he got into the cellar,\\r\\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\\r\\nthat Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\\r\\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\\r\\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\\r\\ntime when it fell down, he cried: â\\x80\\x98Oh, what a clever Elsie!â\\x80\\x99 and sat\\r\\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\\r\\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: â\\x80\\x98They must be\\r\\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\\r\\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. â\\x80\\x98What misfortune has happened\\r\\nthen?â\\x80\\x99 asked he. â\\x80\\x98Ah, dear Hans,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, â\\x80\\x98if we marry each other\\r\\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\\r\\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\\r\\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\\r\\nweep?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Come,â\\x80\\x99 said Hans, â\\x80\\x98more understanding than that is not needed\\r\\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: â\\x80\\x98Wife, I am going out to work\\r\\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\\r\\nmay have some bread.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.â\\x80\\x99 After Hans had\\r\\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\\r\\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: â\\x80\\x98What shall I\\r\\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\\r\\nmore said: â\\x80\\x98What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\\r\\nI will sleep first.â\\x80\\x99 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\\r\\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\\r\\nhe: â\\x80\\x98What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\\r\\neven come home to eat.â\\x80\\x99 But when evening came and she still stayed away,\\r\\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\\r\\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\\r\\na fowlerâ\\x80\\x99s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\\r\\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\\r\\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\\r\\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\\r\\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\\r\\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\\r\\nnot, and said: â\\x80\\x98Is it I, or is it not I?â\\x80\\x99 But she knew not what answer\\r\\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\\r\\nto know.â\\x80\\x99 She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\\r\\nshe knocked at the window and cried: â\\x80\\x98Hans, is Elsie within?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nanswered Hans, â\\x80\\x98she is within.â\\x80\\x99 Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,â\\x80\\x99 and went to another door; but when the\\r\\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\\r\\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\\r\\nseen her since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\\r\\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\\r\\ninto the manâ\\x80\\x99s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\\r\\nso he went to his master, and said, â\\x80\\x98I have worked hard for you a long\\r\\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\\r\\ntrouble.â\\x80\\x99 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\\r\\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every yearâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\\r\\nhave, and said to himself, â\\x80\\x98Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\\r\\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\\r\\nmerry.â\\x80\\x99 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\\r\\nover hill and valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\\r\\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. â\\x80\\x98Why, what should make\\r\\nme down-hearted?â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\\r\\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three yearsâ\\x80\\x99 earnings and have it\\r\\nall safe in my pocket.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How much may it come to?â\\x80\\x99 said the little man.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Full threepence,â\\x80\\x99 replied the countryman. â\\x80\\x98I wish you would give them\\r\\nto me,â\\x80\\x99 said the other; â\\x80\\x98I am very poor.â\\x80\\x99 Then the man pitied him, and\\r\\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, â\\x80\\x98As you have\\r\\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\\r\\npenny; so choose whatever you like.â\\x80\\x99 Then the countryman rejoiced at\\r\\nhis good luck, and said, â\\x80\\x98I like many things better than money: first, I\\r\\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\\r\\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\\r\\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.â\\x80\\x99 The dwarf\\r\\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\\r\\nand went his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\\r\\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\\r\\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\\r\\nsinging away most joyfully. â\\x80\\x98Oh, what a pretty bird!â\\x80\\x99 said the miser; â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If thatâ\\x80\\x99s all,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the countryman, â\\x80\\x98I will soon bring it down.â\\x80\\x99 Then he took up his\\r\\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\\r\\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\\r\\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\\r\\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\\r\\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\\r\\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\\r\\nthe blood ran down. â\\x80\\x98Oh, for heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake!â\\x80\\x99 cried the miser, â\\x80\\x98Master!\\r\\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,â\\x80\\x99 said the other; â\\x80\\x98thou\\r\\nart only meeting thy rewardâ\\x80\\x99: so he played up another tune. Then the\\r\\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\\r\\nhe did not come up to the musicianâ\\x80\\x99s price for some time, and he danced\\r\\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\\r\\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\\r\\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\\r\\nsaw so much money, he said, â\\x80\\x98I will agree to your proposal.â\\x80\\x99 So he took\\r\\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\\r\\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\\r\\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\\r\\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\\r\\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\\r\\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\\r\\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\\r\\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\\r\\nhis money. â\\x80\\x98No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\\r\\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, â\\x80\\x98My Lord\\r\\nJudge, grant me one last request.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Anything but thy life,â\\x80\\x99 replied the\\r\\nother. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\\r\\nmy fiddle for the last time.â\\x80\\x99 The miser cried out, â\\x80\\x98Oh, no! no! for\\r\\nheavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake donâ\\x80\\x99t listen to him! donâ\\x80\\x99t listen to him!â\\x80\\x99 But the judge\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98It is only this once, he will soon have done.â\\x80\\x99 The fact was, he\\r\\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarfâ\\x80\\x99s third gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the miser said, â\\x80\\x98Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pityâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x99 But\\r\\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\\r\\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\\r\\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\\r\\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\\r\\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\\r\\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\\r\\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\\r\\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\\r\\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\\r\\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\\r\\nthe hundred florins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called to the miser, and said, â\\x80\\x98Tell us now, you vagabond, where\\r\\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I stole\\r\\nit,â\\x80\\x99 said the miser in the presence of all the people; â\\x80\\x98I acknowledge\\r\\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.â\\x80\\x99 Then the countryman\\r\\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASHPUTTEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\\r\\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, â\\x80\\x98Always be\\r\\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.â\\x80\\x99 Soon\\r\\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\\r\\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\\r\\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\\r\\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\\r\\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\\r\\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\\r\\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\\r\\nfor the poor little girl. â\\x80\\x98What does the good-for-nothing want in the\\r\\nparlour?â\\x80\\x99 said they; â\\x80\\x98they who would eat bread should first earn it;\\r\\naway with the kitchen-maid!â\\x80\\x99 Then they took away her fine clothes, and\\r\\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\\r\\ninto the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\\r\\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\\r\\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\\r\\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\\r\\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\\r\\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\\r\\nwifeâ\\x80\\x99s daughters what he should bring them. â\\x80\\x98Fine clothes,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nfirst; â\\x80\\x98Pearls and diamonds,â\\x80\\x99 cried the second. â\\x80\\x98Now, child,â\\x80\\x99 said he\\r\\nto his own daughter, â\\x80\\x98what will you have?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The first twig, dear\\r\\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\\r\\nhomewards,â\\x80\\x99 said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\\r\\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\\r\\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\\r\\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\\r\\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\\r\\nher motherâ\\x80\\x99s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\\r\\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\\r\\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\\r\\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\\r\\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\\r\\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\\r\\na bride for himself. Ashputtelâ\\x80\\x99s two sisters were asked to come; so they\\r\\ncalled her up, and said, â\\x80\\x98Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\\r\\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the kingâ\\x80\\x99s feast.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\\r\\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\\r\\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\\r\\nto let her go. â\\x80\\x98You, Ashputtel!â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98you who have nothing to\\r\\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\\r\\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\\r\\nher, â\\x80\\x98I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\\r\\ntwo hoursâ\\x80\\x99 time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\\r\\ntoo.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\\r\\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\\r\\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\\r\\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\\r\\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\\r\\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\\r\\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\\r\\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\\r\\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\\r\\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, â\\x80\\x98No, no! you\\r\\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.â\\x80\\x99 And when\\r\\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, â\\x80\\x98If you can in one hourâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\\r\\ntoo.â\\x80\\x99 And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\\r\\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\\r\\nand cried out as before:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\\r\\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\\r\\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\\r\\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\\r\\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\\r\\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s time all\\r\\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\\r\\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\\r\\nBut her mother said, â\\x80\\x98It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\\r\\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shameâ\\x80\\x99: and off\\r\\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\\r\\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\\r\\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\\r\\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\\r\\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\\r\\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\\r\\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kingâ\\x80\\x99s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\\r\\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\\r\\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, â\\x80\\x98This lady is dancing with me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\\r\\ngo home: and the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son said, â\\x80\\x98I shall go and take care of you to\\r\\nyour homeâ\\x80\\x99; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\\r\\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\\r\\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\\r\\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\\r\\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\\r\\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\\r\\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\\r\\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\\r\\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\\r\\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\\r\\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\\r\\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\\r\\nlittle grey frock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\\r\\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\\r\\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\\r\\nwondered at her beauty: but the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son, who was waiting for her,\\r\\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said as before, â\\x80\\x98This lady is dancing with me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son followed here\\r\\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\\r\\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\\r\\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\\r\\nbeing seen. Then the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son lost sight of her, and could not find\\r\\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\\r\\nto him, â\\x80\\x98The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\\r\\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.â\\x80\\x99 The father thought to\\r\\nhimself, â\\x80\\x98Can it be Ashputtel?â\\x80\\x99 So he had an axe brought; and they cut\\r\\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\\r\\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\\r\\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\\r\\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\\r\\nfrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\\r\\nwent again into the garden, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\\r\\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\\r\\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\\r\\nkingâ\\x80\\x99s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said, â\\x80\\x98This lady is _my_ partner, sir.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son would go with\\r\\nher, and said to himself, â\\x80\\x98I will not lose her this timeâ\\x80\\x99; but, however,\\r\\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\\r\\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\\r\\nfits.â\\x80\\x99 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\\r\\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\\r\\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\\r\\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\\r\\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\\r\\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, â\\x80\\x98Never mind, cut it off; when you\\r\\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.â\\x80\\x99 So\\r\\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\\r\\nand went to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\\r\\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\\r\\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For sheâ\\x80\\x99s not the true one that sits by thy side.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\\r\\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\\r\\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\\r\\non the slipper.â\\x80\\x99 Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\\r\\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\\r\\nin till the blood came, and took her to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son: and he set her\\r\\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\\r\\nand sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For sheâ\\x80\\x99s not the true one that sits by thy side.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\\r\\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\\r\\nand brought her also back again. â\\x80\\x98This is not the true bride,â\\x80\\x99 said he\\r\\nto the father; â\\x80\\x98have you no other daughters?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98there is\\r\\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\\r\\nsure she cannot be the bride.â\\x80\\x99 The prince told him to send her. But the\\r\\nmother said, â\\x80\\x98No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\\r\\nherself.â\\x80\\x99 However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\\r\\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\\r\\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\\r\\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\\r\\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98This is the right bride.â\\x80\\x99 But the mother and both the sisters\\r\\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\\r\\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\\r\\nwhite dove sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Home! home! look at the shoe!\\r\\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\\r\\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\\r\\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\\r\\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\\r\\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\\r\\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\\r\\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\\r\\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\\r\\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\\r\\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\\r\\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\\r\\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\\r\\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\\r\\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\\r\\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\\r\\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\\r\\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\\r\\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\\r\\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\\r\\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\\r\\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\\r\\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\\r\\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\\r\\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\\r\\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\\r\\ndismissed with no better answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\\r\\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\\r\\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\\r\\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\\r\\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\\r\\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\\r\\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\\r\\none said in a pitiful tone: â\\x80\\x98Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\\r\\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queenâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwindow.â\\x80\\x99 The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\\r\\nkitchen, and said to the cook: â\\x80\\x98Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; â\\x80\\x98she has spared\\r\\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\\r\\nenough.â\\x80\\x99 So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\\r\\nspit, the queenâ\\x80\\x99s ring was found inside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\\r\\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\\r\\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\\r\\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\\r\\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\\r\\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\\r\\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\\r\\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\\r\\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\\r\\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\\r\\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: â\\x80\\x98We will remember you\\r\\nand repay you for saving us!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\\r\\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: â\\x80\\x98Why\\r\\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\\r\\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\\r\\nmercy!â\\x80\\x99 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\\r\\nhim: â\\x80\\x98We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\\r\\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. â\\x80\\x98Out with you, you\\r\\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!â\\x80\\x99 cried they; â\\x80\\x98we cannot find food for\\r\\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\\r\\ncrying: â\\x80\\x98Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\\r\\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?â\\x80\\x99 So the\\r\\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\\r\\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\\r\\nhunger, and cried: â\\x80\\x98We will remember you--one good turn deserves\\r\\nanother!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\\r\\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\\r\\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: â\\x80\\x98The kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\\r\\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.â\\x80\\x99 Many had\\r\\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\\r\\nsaw the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\\r\\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\\r\\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\\r\\nbottom of the sea, and added: â\\x80\\x98If you come up again without it you will\\r\\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.â\\x80\\x99 All the\\r\\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\\r\\nalone by the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\\r\\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\\r\\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\\r\\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youthâ\\x80\\x99s feet, and when he\\r\\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\\r\\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\\r\\nthe promised reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\\r\\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\\r\\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\\r\\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: â\\x80\\x98Tomorrow morning\\r\\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\\r\\nwanting.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\\r\\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\\r\\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\\r\\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\\r\\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\\r\\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\\r\\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\\r\\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\\r\\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\\r\\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: â\\x80\\x98Although he\\r\\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\\r\\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.â\\x80\\x99 The youth did not know where\\r\\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\\r\\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\\r\\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\\r\\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\\r\\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\\r\\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\\r\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\\r\\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\\r\\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\\r\\nstands, and have brought you the apple.â\\x80\\x99 The youth, full of joy, set out\\r\\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s beautiful daughter,\\r\\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\\r\\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\\r\\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\\r\\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\\r\\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\\r\\nseven to her and said: â\\x80\\x98Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\\r\\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\\r\\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\\r\\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nkids said: â\\x80\\x98Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\\r\\naway without any anxiety.â\\x80\\x99 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\\r\\nwith an easy mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\\r\\nsomething back with her for each of you.â\\x80\\x99 But the little kids knew that\\r\\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. â\\x80\\x98We will not open the door,â\\x80\\x99 cried\\r\\nthey, â\\x80\\x98you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\\r\\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!â\\x80\\x99 Then the wolf went away to a\\r\\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\\r\\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\\r\\nhouse, and called: â\\x80\\x98Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\\r\\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.â\\x80\\x99 But the wolf\\r\\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\\r\\nand cried: â\\x80\\x98We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\\r\\nlike you: you are the wolf!â\\x80\\x99 Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.â\\x80\\x99 And when the baker\\r\\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: â\\x80\\x98Strew some\\r\\nwhite meal over my feet for me.â\\x80\\x99 The miller thought to himself: â\\x80\\x98The\\r\\nwolf wants to deceive someone,â\\x80\\x99 and refused; but the wolf said: â\\x80\\x98If you\\r\\nwill not do it, I will devour you.â\\x80\\x99 Then the miller was afraid, and made\\r\\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\\r\\nit and said: â\\x80\\x98Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\\r\\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\\r\\nforest with her.â\\x80\\x99 The little kids cried: â\\x80\\x98First show us your paws that\\r\\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.â\\x80\\x99 Then he put his paws\\r\\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\\r\\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\\r\\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\\r\\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\\r\\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\\r\\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\\r\\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\\r\\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\\r\\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\\r\\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\\r\\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\\r\\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\\r\\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\\r\\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\\r\\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\\r\\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\\r\\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\\r\\ncried: â\\x80\\x98Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.â\\x80\\x99 She took the kid out, and\\r\\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\\r\\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\\r\\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\\r\\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\\r\\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\r\\nheavens,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98is it possible that my poor children whom he has\\r\\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?â\\x80\\x99 Then the kid had to\\r\\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\\r\\nopen the monsterâ\\x80\\x99s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\\r\\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\\r\\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\\r\\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\\r\\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\\r\\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: â\\x80\\x98Now\\r\\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beastâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.â\\x80\\x99 Then the seven kids dragged\\r\\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\\r\\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\\r\\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\\r\\nstirred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\\r\\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\\r\\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\\r\\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\\r\\nhe:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98What rumbles and tumbles\\r\\n  Against my poor bones?\\r\\n  I thought â\\x80\\x98twas six kids,\\r\\n  But it feels like big stones.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\\r\\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\\r\\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: â\\x80\\x98The wolf\\r\\nis dead! The wolf is dead!â\\x80\\x99 and danced for joy round about the well with\\r\\ntheir mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE QUEEN BEE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo kingsâ\\x80\\x99 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\\r\\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\\r\\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\\r\\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\\r\\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\\r\\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\\r\\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\\r\\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\\r\\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\\r\\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\\r\\nlittle dwarf said, â\\x80\\x98Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\\r\\nsuffer you to trouble them.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\\r\\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\\r\\ndwarf said, â\\x80\\x98Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\\r\\nthem.â\\x80\\x99 Next they came to a beesâ\\x80\\x99-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\\r\\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\\r\\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\\r\\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, â\\x80\\x98Let the pretty insects enjoy\\r\\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\\r\\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\\r\\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\\r\\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\\r\\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\\r\\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\\r\\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\\r\\nhe rose and came out to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\\r\\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\\r\\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\\r\\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\\r\\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: â\\x80\\x98In the\\r\\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\\r\\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\\r\\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\\r\\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\\r\\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\\r\\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last came the little dwarfâ\\x80\\x99s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\\r\\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\\r\\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\\r\\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\\r\\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\\r\\nheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tablet said: â\\x80\\x98The key of the princessâ\\x80\\x99s bed-chamber must be\\r\\nfished up out of the lake.â\\x80\\x99 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\\r\\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\\r\\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\\r\\nthe best of the kingâ\\x80\\x99s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\\r\\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\\r\\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\\r\\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\\r\\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\\r\\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\\r\\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\\r\\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\\r\\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\\r\\nher fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\\r\\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\\r\\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\\r\\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\\r\\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\\r\\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\\r\\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\\r\\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\\r\\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\\r\\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\\r\\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\\r\\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\\r\\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\\r\\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\\r\\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\\r\\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\\r\\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\\r\\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\\r\\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\\r\\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\\r\\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\\r\\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, â\\x80\\x98I should like to sit up and\\r\\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x99 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\\r\\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\\r\\nthere, and watched what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\\r\\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s bench, took up all the work\\r\\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\\r\\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\\r\\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\\r\\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\\r\\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\\r\\nlightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. â\\x80\\x98These little wights have\\r\\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\\r\\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\\r\\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\\r\\nkeep off the cold. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\\r\\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\\r\\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\\r\\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\\r\\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\\r\\nwatch what the little elves would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\\r\\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\\r\\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\\r\\nmightily delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\\r\\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\\r\\nout at the door, and away over the green.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\\r\\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\\r\\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\\r\\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\\r\\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\\r\\nremained childless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\\r\\nOne winterâ\\x80\\x99s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\\r\\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\\r\\nsnow. â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 sighed the woman heavily, â\\x80\\x98if I had but a child, as red as\\r\\nblood and as white as snow,â\\x80\\x99 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\\r\\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\\r\\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\\r\\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\\r\\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\\r\\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\\r\\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\\r\\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\\r\\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\\r\\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\\r\\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\\r\\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\\r\\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. â\\x80\\x98If I\\r\\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.â\\x80\\x99 Then she felt comforted and happy\\r\\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\\r\\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\\r\\nwas so great that she died.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\\r\\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\\r\\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\\r\\non he married again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\\r\\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\\r\\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\\r\\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\\r\\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\\r\\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\\r\\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\\r\\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\\r\\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\\r\\nschool to the time he went back.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\\r\\nstore-room, and said, â\\x80\\x98Mother, give me an apple.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, my child,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\\r\\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Mother,â\\x80\\x99 said the little daughter again, â\\x80\\x98may not brother have one\\r\\ntoo?â\\x80\\x99 The mother was angry at this, but she answered, â\\x80\\x98Yes, when he\\r\\ncomes out of school.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\\r\\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\\r\\nof her little daughterâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and said, â\\x80\\x98You shall not have one before\\r\\nyour brother.â\\x80\\x99 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\\r\\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\\r\\nkindly to him, â\\x80\\x98My son, will you have an apple?â\\x80\\x99 but she gave him a\\r\\nwicked look. â\\x80\\x98Mother,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, â\\x80\\x98how dreadful you look! Yes, give\\r\\nme an apple.â\\x80\\x99 The thought came to her that she would kill him. â\\x80\\x98Come\\r\\nwith me,â\\x80\\x99 she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; â\\x80\\x98take one\\r\\nout for yourself.â\\x80\\x99 And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\\r\\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boyâ\\x80\\x99s head.\\r\\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,â\\x80\\x99 she thought. So\\r\\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\\r\\nher top drawer; then she set the boyâ\\x80\\x99s head again on his shoulders, and\\r\\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\\r\\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\\r\\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, â\\x80\\x98Mother, brother is\\r\\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\\r\\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\\r\\nfrightened me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Go to him again,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, â\\x80\\x98and if he does not answer, give him\\r\\na box on the ear.â\\x80\\x99 So little Marleen went, and said, â\\x80\\x98Brother, give me\\r\\nthat apple,â\\x80\\x99 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\\r\\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\\r\\ncrying and screaming to her mother. â\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98I have knocked off\\r\\nbrotherâ\\x80\\x99s head,â\\x80\\x99 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What have you done!â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, â\\x80\\x98but no one must know about it,\\r\\nso you must keep silence; what is done canâ\\x80\\x99t be undone; we will make\\r\\nhim into puddings.â\\x80\\x99 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\\r\\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\\r\\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\\r\\nneed of salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where is my son?â\\x80\\x99 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\\r\\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father again asked, â\\x80\\x98Where is my son?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 answered the wife, â\\x80\\x98he is gone into the country to his motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\\r\\nweeks; he is well looked after there.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I feel very unhappy about it,â\\x80\\x99 said the husband, â\\x80\\x98in case it should not\\r\\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, â\\x80\\x98Little Marleen, why do\\r\\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.â\\x80\\x99 Then he asked his wife for more\\r\\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\\r\\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\\r\\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\\r\\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\\r\\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\\r\\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\\r\\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\\r\\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\\r\\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\\r\\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\\r\\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\\r\\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\\r\\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\\r\\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\\r\\nthe table and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\\r\\nsing:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\\r\\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\\r\\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\\r\\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\\r\\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\\r\\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\\r\\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bird,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nay,â\\x80\\x99 said the bird, â\\x80\\x98I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\\r\\nchain, and I will sing it you again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Here is the chain, take it,â\\x80\\x99 said the goldsmith. â\\x80\\x98Only sing me that\\r\\nagain.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\\r\\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s house and\\r\\nsang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\\r\\nshirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\\r\\nhand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bird,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98how beautifully you sing!â\\x80\\x99 Then he called through the\\r\\ndoor to his wife: â\\x80\\x98Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\\r\\nand hear how beautifully it sings.â\\x80\\x99 Then he called his daughter and the\\r\\nchildren, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\\r\\nstreet to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\\r\\nand green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\\r\\nbright stars in its head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bird,â\\x80\\x99 said the shoemaker, â\\x80\\x98sing me that song again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nay,â\\x80\\x99 answered the bird, â\\x80\\x98I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\\r\\ngive me something.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Wife,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\\r\\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.â\\x80\\x99 The wife went in and fetched\\r\\nthe shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, bird,â\\x80\\x99 said the shoemaker, â\\x80\\x98now sing me that song again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\\r\\nwent back to the roof and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\\r\\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\\r\\nmill went â\\x80\\x98Click clack, click clack, click clack.â\\x80\\x99 Inside the mill were\\r\\ntwenty of the millerâ\\x80\\x99s men hewing a stone, and as they went â\\x80\\x98Hick hack,\\r\\nhick hack, hick hack,â\\x80\\x99 the mill went â\\x80\\x98Click clack, click clack, click\\r\\nclack.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen one of the men left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo more men left off and listened,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen four more left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nnow there were only eight at work,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only five,\\r\\n\\r\\n  the juniper-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only one,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bird,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\\r\\ntoo; sing it again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nay,â\\x80\\x99 answered the bird, â\\x80\\x98I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\\r\\nmillstone, and I will sing it again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If it belonged to me alone,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98you should have it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the others: â\\x80\\x98if he will sing again, he can have it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\\r\\nstone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\\r\\nthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\\r\\ntree and sang--\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\\r\\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\\r\\nhis neck, he flew right away to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98How lighthearted I feel,â\\x80\\x99 said the father, â\\x80\\x98so pleased and cheerful.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98And I,â\\x80\\x99 said the mother, â\\x80\\x98I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\\r\\nwere coming.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I do feel so happy,â\\x80\\x99 said the father, â\\x80\\x98and how beautifully the sun\\r\\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said the wife, â\\x80\\x98and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\\r\\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\\r\\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\\r\\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\\r\\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look, mother,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98at the beautiful bird that is singing so\\r\\nmagnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\\r\\nscent of spice in the air!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I must go outside and see the bird nearer,â\\x80\\x99 said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, do not go!â\\x80\\x99 cried the wife. â\\x80\\x98I feel as if the whole house were in\\r\\nflames!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went inside, and said, â\\x80\\x98See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\\r\\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\\r\\nand her cap fell from her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah me!â\\x80\\x99 cried the wife, â\\x80\\x98if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\\r\\nearth, that I might not hear that song.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said little Marleen, â\\x80\\x98I will go out too and see if the bird will\\r\\ngive me anything.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\\r\\ndanced and jumped about in them. â\\x80\\x98I was so miserable,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98when I\\r\\ncame out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\\r\\nand he has given me a pair of red shoes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\\r\\nof fire. â\\x80\\x98Then I will go out too,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98and see if it will lighten\\r\\nmy misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\\r\\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\\r\\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\\r\\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\\r\\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\\r\\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TURNIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\\r\\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\\r\\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\\r\\nand sowed turnips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\\r\\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\\r\\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\\r\\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\\r\\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\\r\\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\\r\\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, â\\x80\\x98What\\r\\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\\r\\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\\r\\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\\r\\nto the king. â\\x80\\x98What a wonderful thing!â\\x80\\x99 said the king; â\\x80\\x98I have seen many\\r\\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\\r\\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\\r\\nof fortune.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, no!â\\x80\\x99 answered the gardener, â\\x80\\x98I am no child of fortune;\\r\\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\\r\\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\\r\\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\\r\\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, â\\x80\\x98You shall be poor no\\r\\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\\r\\nbrother.â\\x80\\x99 Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\\r\\nrich that his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\\r\\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\\r\\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\\r\\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\\r\\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\\r\\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\\r\\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\\r\\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\\r\\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\\r\\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\\r\\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\\r\\nkill his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\\r\\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, â\\x80\\x98Dear brother, I have\\r\\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\\r\\nus.â\\x80\\x99 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\\r\\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\\r\\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\\r\\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\\r\\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\\r\\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\\r\\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\\r\\nhis head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\\r\\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\\r\\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, â\\x80\\x98Good\\r\\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!â\\x80\\x99 The student looked about\\r\\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\\r\\nfrom, cried out, â\\x80\\x98Who calls me?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man in the tree answered, â\\x80\\x98Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\\r\\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\\r\\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\\r\\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\\r\\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\\r\\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\\r\\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\\r\\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\\r\\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\\r\\nand own the power of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\\r\\nlet me into the sack for a little while?â\\x80\\x99 Then the other answered, as if\\r\\nvery unwillingly, â\\x80\\x98A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\\r\\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\\r\\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\\r\\nto me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\\r\\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\\r\\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\\r\\nway, and said, â\\x80\\x98Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\\r\\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.â\\x80\\x99 So the student let him down,\\r\\nopened the sack, and set him free. â\\x80\\x98Now then,â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98let me ascend\\r\\nquickly.â\\x80\\x99 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, â\\x80\\x98Wait a\\r\\nwhile,â\\x80\\x99 said the gardener, â\\x80\\x98that is not the way.â\\x80\\x99 Then he pushed him\\r\\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\\r\\nwisdom dangling in the air. â\\x80\\x98How is it with thee, friend?â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\\r\\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he trotted off on the studentâ\\x80\\x99s nag, and left the poor fellow\\r\\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother of Hans said: â\\x80\\x98Whither away, Hans?â\\x80\\x99 Hans answered: â\\x80\\x98To\\r\\nGretel.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Behave well, Hans.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll behave well.

Then Gretel became angry, tore herself\\r\\nloose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\\r\\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: â\\x80\\x98Hark you,\\r\\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from\\r\\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\\r\\nsee what he can do with you.â\\x80\\x99 The youth was sent into a strange town,\\r\\nand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,\\r\\nhe came home again, and his father asked: â\\x80\\x98Now, my son, what have you\\r\\nlearnt?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Lord\\r\\nhave mercy on us!â\\x80\\x99 cried the father; â\\x80\\x98is that all you have learnt? I\\r\\nwill send you into another town, to another master.â\\x80\\x99 The youth was taken\\r\\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back\\r\\nthe father again asked: â\\x80\\x98My son, what have you learnt?â\\x80\\x99 He answered:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Father, I have learnt what the birds say.â\\x80\\x99 Then the father fell into a\\r\\nrage and said: â\\x80\\x98Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and\\r\\nlearnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will\\r\\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\\r\\nwill no longer be your father.â\\x80\\x99 The youth remained a whole year with the\\r\\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My son, what have you learnt?â\\x80\\x99 he answered: â\\x80\\x98Dear father, I have this\\r\\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.â\\x80\\x99 Then the father fell into the most\\r\\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: â\\x80\\x98This man\\r\\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\\r\\nout into the forest, and kill him.â\\x80\\x99 They took him forth, but when they\\r\\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\\r\\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\\r\\nthem to the old man as a token.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\\r\\nbegged for a nightâ\\x80\\x99s lodging. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the lord of the castle, â\\x80\\x98if\\r\\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\\r\\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\\r\\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\\r\\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.â\\x80\\x99 The whole district was in\\r\\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\\r\\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: â\\x80\\x98Just let me\\r\\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\\r\\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.â\\x80\\x99 As he himself would have it so,\\r\\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\\r\\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\\r\\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\\r\\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\\r\\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\\r\\nthe castle: â\\x80\\x98The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\\r\\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\\r\\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\\r\\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\\r\\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.â\\x80\\x99 Then all who\\r\\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\\r\\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\\r\\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\\r\\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\\r\\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\\r\\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\\r\\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\\r\\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\\r\\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\\r\\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\\r\\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\\r\\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\\r\\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\\r\\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\\r\\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\\r\\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\\r\\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\\r\\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\\r\\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\\r\\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\\r\\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\\r\\nherself: â\\x80\\x98He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\\r\\nworld,â\\x80\\x99 she spoke to him in a friendly way. â\\x80\\x98Good day, dear Mr Fox,\\r\\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\\r\\ntimes?â\\x80\\x99 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\\r\\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\\r\\nany answer or not. At last he said: â\\x80\\x98Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\\r\\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\\r\\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\\r\\nmany arts do you understand?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I understand but one,â\\x80\\x99 replied the\\r\\ncat, modestly. â\\x80\\x98What art is that?â\\x80\\x99 asked the fox. â\\x80\\x98When the hounds are\\r\\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Is that all?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the fox. â\\x80\\x98I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\\r\\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\\r\\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.â\\x80\\x99 Just then came a hunter\\r\\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\\r\\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. â\\x80\\x98Open your\\r\\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,â\\x80\\x99 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\\r\\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. â\\x80\\x98Ah, Mr Fox,â\\x80\\x99 cried the\\r\\ncat. â\\x80\\x98You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\\r\\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dear children,â\\x80\\x99 said a poor man to his four sons, â\\x80\\x98I have nothing to\\r\\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\\r\\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.â\\x80\\x99 So the\\r\\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\\r\\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\\r\\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\\r\\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\\r\\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\\r\\nhimself.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\\r\\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. â\\x80\\x98I am\\r\\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\\r\\nsome art or trade,â\\x80\\x99 answered he. â\\x80\\x98Then,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98go with me, and\\r\\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the other, â\\x80\\x98that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\\r\\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98you need\\r\\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\\r\\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\\r\\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.â\\x80\\x99 So the young man\\r\\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\\r\\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\\r\\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. â\\x80\\x98I do not\\r\\nknow yet,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\\r\\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\\r\\nthe stars.â\\x80\\x99 The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\\r\\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\\r\\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, â\\x80\\x98With this you can see all\\r\\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\\r\\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\\r\\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\\r\\ndo. â\\x80\\x98Would not you like,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98to be a tailor?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, no!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe young man; â\\x80\\x98sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\\r\\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 answered the man, â\\x80\\x98that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\\r\\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.â\\x80\\x99 Not knowing\\r\\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\\r\\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\\r\\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\\r\\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\\r\\nset off towards their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s home, where they told him all that had\\r\\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\\r\\ntree, the father said, â\\x80\\x98I should like to try what each of you can do in\\r\\nthis way.â\\x80\\x99 So he looked up, and said to the second son, â\\x80\\x98At the top of\\r\\nthis tree there is a chaffinchâ\\x80\\x99s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\\r\\nin it.â\\x80\\x99 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, â\\x80\\x98Five.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now,â\\x80\\x99 said the father to the eldest son, â\\x80\\x98take away the eggs without\\r\\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\\r\\nanything of what you are doing.â\\x80\\x99 So the cunning thief climbed up the\\r\\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\\r\\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\\r\\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\\r\\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, â\\x80\\x98Cut all\\r\\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.â\\x80\\x99 The huntsman took up his bow, and\\r\\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now comes your turn,â\\x80\\x99 said he to the young tailor; â\\x80\\x98sew the eggs and\\r\\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\\r\\nhave done them no harm.â\\x80\\x99 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\\r\\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\\r\\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\\r\\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\\r\\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\\r\\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well done, sons!â\\x80\\x99 said the old man; â\\x80\\x98you have made good use of your\\r\\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\\r\\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\\r\\nyou to turn your skill to some account!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\\r\\nkingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\\r\\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\\r\\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\\r\\nbrothers said to each other, â\\x80\\x98Here is a chance for us; let us try\\r\\nwhat we can do.â\\x80\\x99 And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\\r\\nprincess free. â\\x80\\x98I will soon find out where she is, however,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\\r\\ndragon close by, guarding her.â\\x80\\x99 Then he went to the king, and asked for\\r\\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\\r\\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\\r\\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\\r\\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. â\\x80\\x98I dare not shoot at him,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the huntsman, â\\x80\\x98for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then I will try my skill,â\\x80\\x99 said the thief, and went and stole her away\\r\\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\\r\\nit, but went on snoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\\r\\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\\r\\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\\r\\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\\r\\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\\r\\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\\r\\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\\r\\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\\r\\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\\r\\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\\r\\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\\r\\nreached the ship and got home safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\\r\\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, â\\x80\\x98One of you shall marry\\r\\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, â\\x80\\x98If I had\\r\\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your seeing her would have been of\\r\\nno use,â\\x80\\x99 said the thief, â\\x80\\x98if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, she is mine,â\\x80\\x99 said the huntsman;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\\r\\nand the princess into pieces.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And if I had not sewn the boat together\\r\\nagain,â\\x80\\x99 said the tailor, â\\x80\\x98you would all have been drowned, therefore she\\r\\nis mine.â\\x80\\x99 Then the king put in a word, and said, â\\x80\\x98Each of you is right;\\r\\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\\r\\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\\r\\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\\r\\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.â\\x80\\x99 So the brothers agreed that this\\r\\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\\r\\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\\r\\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\\r\\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\\r\\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\\r\\nher again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLILY AND THE LION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\\r\\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\\r\\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\\r\\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, â\\x80\\x98Dear father, bring me a\\r\\nrose.â\\x80\\x99 Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\\r\\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\\r\\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\\r\\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\\r\\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\\r\\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\\r\\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\\r\\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\\r\\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\\r\\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\\r\\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\\r\\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\\r\\ndreary and buried in the snow. â\\x80\\x98A lucky hit!â\\x80\\x99 said he, as he called to\\r\\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\\r\\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\\r\\nlion, and roared out, â\\x80\\x98Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\\r\\nalive!â\\x80\\x99 Then the man said, â\\x80\\x98I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\\r\\ncan nothing save my life?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No!â\\x80\\x99 said the lion, â\\x80\\x98nothing, unless you\\r\\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\\r\\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\\r\\ndaughter.â\\x80\\x99 But the man was unwilling to do so and said, â\\x80\\x98It may be my\\r\\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\\r\\nI go home.â\\x80\\x99 Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, â\\x80\\x98It may\\r\\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.â\\x80\\x99 And at last the man yielded with a\\r\\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\\r\\nshould meet him first on his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\\r\\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\\r\\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\\r\\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\\r\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x98Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\\r\\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\\r\\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.â\\x80\\x99 Then he told her all that\\r\\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she comforted him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Dear father, the word you have given\\r\\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\\r\\nme come safe home again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\\r\\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\\r\\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\\r\\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\\r\\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\\r\\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\\r\\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\\r\\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\\r\\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he said to her, â\\x80\\x98Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\\r\\nyour fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\\r\\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.â\\x80\\x99 Then she\\r\\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\\r\\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\\r\\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\\r\\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\\r\\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, â\\x80\\x98I will not go alone this\\r\\ntime--you must go with me.â\\x80\\x99 But he would not, and said that it would be\\r\\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\\r\\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\\r\\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\\r\\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\\r\\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\\r\\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\\r\\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\\r\\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\\r\\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\\r\\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\\r\\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\\r\\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\\r\\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\\r\\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\\r\\nfree.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\\r\\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\\r\\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\\r\\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\\r\\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\\r\\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\\r\\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\\r\\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now,â\\x80\\x99 thought she to herself, â\\x80\\x98no aid of man can be of use to me.â\\x80\\x99 So\\r\\nshe went to the sun and said, â\\x80\\x98Thou shinest everywhere, on the hillâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntop and the valleyâ\\x80\\x99s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the sun, â\\x80\\x98I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\\r\\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\\r\\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, â\\x80\\x98Thou shinest through the\\r\\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the moon, â\\x80\\x98I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\\r\\negg--break it when need comes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\\r\\nraised up her voice to it, and said, â\\x80\\x98Thou blowest through every tree\\r\\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nnight-wind, â\\x80\\x98but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x99 Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\\r\\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, â\\x80\\x98I have seen the white dove--he\\r\\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\\r\\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\\r\\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99 Then the night-wind said, â\\x80\\x98I will give thee counsel. Go to the\\r\\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\\r\\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\\r\\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\\r\\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\\r\\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\\r\\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\\r\\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,â\\x80\\x99 continued the night-wind.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\\r\\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\\r\\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\\r\\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\\r\\nyou both fall into the sea.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\\r\\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\\r\\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\\r\\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\\r\\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffinâ\\x80\\x99s back, and went off\\r\\ncarrying the prince away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\\r\\ntook heart and said, â\\x80\\x98As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\\r\\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.â\\x80\\x99 She went on for\\r\\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\\r\\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\\r\\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. â\\x80\\x98Heaven aid me now!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\\r\\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\\r\\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\\r\\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\\r\\nsold. â\\x80\\x98Not for gold and silver.â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98but for flesh and blood.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, â\\x80\\x98Let me speak with the\\r\\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\\r\\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\\r\\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\\r\\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\\r\\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\\r\\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?â\\x80\\x99 But the prince all the time\\r\\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\\r\\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\\r\\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\\r\\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\\r\\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\\r\\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\\r\\nnestled under the old oneâ\\x80\\x99s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\\r\\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\\r\\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\\r\\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. â\\x80\\x98Not for gold or silver, but\\r\\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\\r\\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\\r\\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\\r\\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\\r\\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\\r\\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\\r\\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\\r\\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\\r\\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\\r\\nhe knew his beloved wifeâ\\x80\\x99s voice, and sprang up, and said, â\\x80\\x98You have\\r\\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\\r\\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\\r\\nyou to me in a lucky hour.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\\r\\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\\r\\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\\r\\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\\r\\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\\r\\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\\r\\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\\r\\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\\r\\nnothing more to eat, and said, â\\x80\\x98I want you no longer, so take yourself\\r\\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\\r\\nstronger than a lion.â\\x80\\x99 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\\r\\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\\r\\na fox met him: â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter, my friend?â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98why do you hang\\r\\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 replied the\\r\\nhorse, â\\x80\\x98justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\\r\\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\\r\\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\\r\\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\\r\\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, â\\x80\\x98I will help you;\\r\\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\\r\\ndead.â\\x80\\x99 The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\\r\\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, â\\x80\\x98A little way off\\r\\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\\r\\nhis carcase.â\\x80\\x99 The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\\r\\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, â\\x80\\x98You will not be able to eat\\r\\nhim comfortably here; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\\r\\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\\r\\nleisure.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\\r\\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\\r\\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\\r\\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\\r\\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, â\\x80\\x98Jip! Dobbin! Jip!â\\x80\\x99 Then up he sprang,\\r\\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\\r\\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\\r\\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\\r\\nmasterâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Here he is, master,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I have got the better of himâ\\x80\\x99: and when\\r\\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. â\\x80\\x98Thou\\r\\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.â\\x80\\x99 And so the poor old\\r\\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\\r\\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\\r\\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\\r\\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\\r\\nservice for them.â\\x80\\x99 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\\r\\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\\r\\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\\r\\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. â\\x80\\x98Do give\\r\\nme one nightâ\\x80\\x99s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,â\\x80\\x99 said he to\\r\\nher, â\\x80\\x98or I shall starve.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oho!â\\x80\\x99 she answered, â\\x80\\x98who gives anything to a\\r\\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\\r\\nwill do what I wish.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What do you wish?â\\x80\\x99 said the soldier. â\\x80\\x98That you\\r\\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.â\\x80\\x99 The soldier consented,\\r\\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\\r\\nthe evening. â\\x80\\x98I see well enough,â\\x80\\x99 said the witch, â\\x80\\x98that you can do no\\r\\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\\r\\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\\r\\nproposed that he should stay one night more. â\\x80\\x98Tomorrow, you shall only\\r\\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\\r\\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\\r\\nout, and you shall bring it up again.â\\x80\\x99 Next day the old woman took him\\r\\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\\r\\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\\r\\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\\r\\nblue light away from him. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said he, perceiving her evil intention,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\\r\\nthe ground.â\\x80\\x99 The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\\r\\nwell, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\\r\\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\\r\\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\\r\\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\\r\\nwas still half full. â\\x80\\x98This shall be my last pleasure,â\\x80\\x99 thought he,\\r\\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\\r\\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\\r\\nbefore him, and said: â\\x80\\x98Lord, what are your commands?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What my commands\\r\\nare?â\\x80\\x99 replied the soldier, quite astonished. â\\x80\\x98I must do everything you\\r\\nbid me,â\\x80\\x99 said the little man. â\\x80\\x98Good,â\\x80\\x99 said the soldier; â\\x80\\x98then in the\\r\\nfirst place help me out of this well.â\\x80\\x99 The little man took him by the\\r\\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\\r\\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\\r\\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\\r\\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\\r\\nto the little man: â\\x80\\x98Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\\r\\nthe judge.â\\x80\\x99 In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\\r\\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\\r\\nreappeared. â\\x80\\x98It is all done,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98and the witch is already hanging\\r\\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?â\\x80\\x99 inquired the dwarf.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98At this moment, none,â\\x80\\x99 answered the soldier; â\\x80\\x98you can return home, only\\r\\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nothing more is needed than\\r\\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\\r\\nbefore you at once.â\\x80\\x99 Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\\r\\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\\r\\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\\r\\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\\r\\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What am I to\\r\\ndo?â\\x80\\x99 asked the little man. â\\x80\\x98Late at night, when the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter is\\r\\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servantâ\\x80\\x99s work for\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x99 The manikin said: â\\x80\\x98That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\\r\\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nWhen twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\\r\\ncarried in the princess. â\\x80\\x98Aha! are you there?â\\x80\\x99 cried the soldier, â\\x80\\x98get\\r\\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\\r\\nstretched out his feet and said: â\\x80\\x98Pull off my boots,â\\x80\\x99 and then he\\r\\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\\r\\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\\r\\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\\r\\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\\r\\nin her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\\r\\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. â\\x80\\x98I was carried through the\\r\\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98and taken into a\\r\\nsoldierâ\\x80\\x99s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\\r\\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\\r\\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The dream may have been true,â\\x80\\x99 said the king. â\\x80\\x98I will give you a piece\\r\\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\\r\\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\\r\\nleave a track in the streets.â\\x80\\x99 But unseen by the king, the manikin was\\r\\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\\r\\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\\r\\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\\r\\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\\r\\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servantâ\\x80\\x99s work until\\r\\ncock-crow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\\r\\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\\r\\npeas, and saying: â\\x80\\x98It must have rained peas, last night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We must think\\r\\nof something else,â\\x80\\x99 said the king; â\\x80\\x98keep your shoes on when you go to\\r\\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\\r\\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.â\\x80\\x99 The black manikin\\r\\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\\r\\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\\r\\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\\r\\nin the soldierâ\\x80\\x99s house it would go badly with him. â\\x80\\x98Do what I bid you,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\\r\\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\\r\\nthe bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshoe. It was found at the soldierâ\\x80\\x99s, and the soldier himself, who at the\\r\\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\\r\\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\\r\\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\\r\\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\\r\\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\\r\\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\\r\\nhim: â\\x80\\x98Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\\r\\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.â\\x80\\x99 His comrade ran\\r\\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\\r\\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. â\\x80\\x98Have no\\r\\nfear,â\\x80\\x99 said the latter to his master. â\\x80\\x98Go wheresoever they take you, and\\r\\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.â\\x80\\x99 Next day\\r\\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\\r\\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\\r\\nfavour of the king. â\\x80\\x98What is it?â\\x80\\x99 asked the king. â\\x80\\x98That I may smoke one\\r\\nmore pipe on my way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You may smoke three,â\\x80\\x99 answered the king, â\\x80\\x98but do\\r\\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.â\\x80\\x99 Then the soldier pulled out\\r\\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\\r\\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\\r\\nhand, and said: â\\x80\\x98What does my lord command?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Strike down to earth that\\r\\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\\r\\ntreated me so ill.â\\x80\\x99 Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\\r\\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\\r\\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\\r\\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldierâ\\x80\\x99s mercy, and merely to\\r\\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\\r\\ndaughter to wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RAVEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\\r\\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\\r\\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\\r\\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: â\\x80\\x98I wish you\\r\\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\\r\\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\\r\\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\\r\\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\\r\\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\\r\\nnear, the raven said, â\\x80\\x98I am by birth a kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, but am now under\\r\\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What\\r\\nam I to do?â\\x80\\x99 he asked. She replied, â\\x80\\x98Go farther into the wood until you\\r\\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\\r\\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\\r\\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\\r\\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\\r\\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon for\\r\\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\\r\\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\\r\\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, â\\x80\\x98Alas! I\\r\\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\\r\\nto save me.â\\x80\\x99 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\\r\\na thing to eat or drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\\r\\nsomething to eat and drink.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 answered the man, â\\x80\\x98I will neither eat not drink.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, â\\x80\\x98If you will\\r\\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\\r\\ncounts for nothing,â\\x80\\x99 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\\r\\ndrank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\\r\\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\\r\\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\\r\\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\\r\\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\\r\\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\\r\\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep.â\\x80\\x99 When she entered the garden, there she found\\r\\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\\r\\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\\r\\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\\r\\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\\r\\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards two oâ\\x80\\x99clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\\r\\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\\r\\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\\r\\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\\r\\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\\r\\nto herself, â\\x80\\x98I know he has fallen asleep.â\\x80\\x99 She went as before to look\\r\\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the old woman said to him, â\\x80\\x98What is this? You are not\\r\\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered, â\\x80\\x98I may not and will not either eat or drink.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\\r\\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\\r\\ntook a deep draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\\r\\nthe garden to await the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\\r\\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\\r\\nhe slept like a log. At two oâ\\x80\\x99clock the raven could be seen approaching,\\r\\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\\r\\nhorses, were black.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.â\\x80\\x99 She\\r\\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\\r\\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\\r\\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\\r\\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\\r\\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\\r\\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\\r\\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\\r\\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\\r\\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.â\\x80\\x99 She then\\r\\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\\r\\nat heart, and said, â\\x80\\x98She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\\r\\nand it is now too late for me to save her.â\\x80\\x99 Then his eyes fell on the\\r\\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\\r\\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\\r\\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\\r\\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\\r\\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\\r\\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\\r\\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\\r\\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\\r\\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\\r\\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\\r\\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\\r\\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\\r\\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\\r\\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98If the giant\\r\\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.â\\x80\\x99 However, after a\\r\\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\\r\\nhe called out, â\\x80\\x98It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\\r\\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nwould rather you let that alone,â\\x80\\x99 said the man, â\\x80\\x98for I do not willingly\\r\\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\\r\\nsatisfy your hunger.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If that is so,â\\x80\\x99 replied the giant, â\\x80\\x98I will leave\\r\\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\\r\\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\\r\\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\\r\\nate and drank to his heartâ\\x80\\x99s content. When he had finished his supper\\r\\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\\r\\nThe giant said, â\\x80\\x98I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\\r\\nvillages, and houses.â\\x80\\x99 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\\r\\nbut could not find it. â\\x80\\x98Never mind,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98I have larger maps\\r\\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,â\\x80\\x99 but they searched in\\r\\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\\r\\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\\r\\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\\r\\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\\r\\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\\r\\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\\r\\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\\r\\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\\r\\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\\r\\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. â\\x80\\x98How shall I\\r\\nbe able to get there?â\\x80\\x99 asked the man. â\\x80\\x98I have two hours to spare,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe giant, â\\x80\\x98and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\\r\\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\\r\\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, â\\x80\\x98You will be able to walk the\\r\\nremainder of the way yourself.â\\x80\\x99 The man journeyed on day and night\\r\\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\\r\\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\\r\\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\\r\\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\\r\\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\\r\\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\\r\\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, â\\x80\\x98I will remain here and wait for\\r\\nher,â\\x80\\x99 so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\\r\\na whole year, and every day he saw the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter driving round her\\r\\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\\r\\ncalled out to them, â\\x80\\x98God be with you.â\\x80\\x99 They stopped when they heard the\\r\\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\\r\\nfighting, which now became more furious. â\\x80\\x98God be with you,â\\x80\\x99 he cried\\r\\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\\r\\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, â\\x80\\x98God be with you,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\\r\\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\\r\\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\\r\\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\\r\\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\\r\\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\\r\\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\\r\\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\\r\\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\\r\\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, â\\x80\\x98I will give you something in\\r\\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\\r\\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\\r\\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\\r\\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\\r\\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\\r\\nanother, crying, â\\x80\\x98There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\\r\\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\\r\\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\\r\\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\\r\\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\\r\\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\\r\\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\\r\\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is my own ring,â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98and if that is so the man must\\r\\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\\r\\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\\r\\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\\r\\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\\r\\nshe kissed him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\\r\\nwe will celebrate our marriage.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\\r\\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] Simpleton\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\\r\\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\\r\\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\\r\\nhim good day, and said: â\\x80\\x98Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\\r\\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.â\\x80\\x99 But\\r\\nthe clever son answered: â\\x80\\x98If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\\r\\nnone for myself; be off with you,â\\x80\\x99 and he left the little man standing\\r\\nand went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\\r\\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\\r\\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey manâ\\x80\\x99s doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\\r\\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\\r\\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\\r\\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: â\\x80\\x98What I give you will be\\r\\ntaken away from myself; be off!â\\x80\\x99 and he left the little man standing and\\r\\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\\r\\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\\r\\ncarried home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Dummling said: â\\x80\\x98Father, do let me go and cut wood.â\\x80\\x99 The father\\r\\nanswered: â\\x80\\x98Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\\r\\nyou do not understand anything about it.â\\x80\\x99 But Dummling begged so long\\r\\nthat at last he said: â\\x80\\x98Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\\r\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x99 His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\\r\\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\\r\\nand greeting him, said: â\\x80\\x98Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\\r\\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.â\\x80\\x99 Dummling answered: â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\\r\\ndown and eat.â\\x80\\x99 So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\\r\\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\\r\\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: â\\x80\\x98Since\\r\\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\\r\\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\\r\\nfind something at the roots.â\\x80\\x99 Then the little man took leave of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\\r\\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\\r\\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\\r\\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\\r\\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\\r\\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest thought: â\\x80\\x98I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\\r\\nfeather,â\\x80\\x99 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\\r\\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\\r\\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\\r\\nwas held fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\\r\\nscreamed out: â\\x80\\x98Keep away; for goodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake keep away!â\\x80\\x99 But she did\\r\\nnot understand why she was to keep away. â\\x80\\x98The others are there,â\\x80\\x99 she\\r\\nthought, â\\x80\\x98I may as well be there too,â\\x80\\x99 and ran to them; but as soon as\\r\\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\\r\\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\\r\\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\\r\\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\\r\\nwherever his legs took him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\\r\\nprocession he said: â\\x80\\x98For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\\r\\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?â\\x80\\x99 At the\\r\\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\\r\\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\\r\\nobliged to run behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\\r\\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: â\\x80\\x98Hi!\\r\\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\\r\\nchristening today!â\\x80\\x99 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\\r\\nwas also held fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\\r\\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\\r\\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\\r\\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\\r\\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\\r\\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\\r\\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\\r\\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\\r\\nbefore the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\\r\\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\\r\\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\\r\\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\\r\\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\\r\\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\\r\\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\\r\\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\\r\\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\\r\\nsorely, and he answered: â\\x80\\x98I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\\r\\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\\r\\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, I can help you,â\\x80\\x99 said Dummling, â\\x80\\x98just come with me and you shall\\r\\nbe satisfied.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led him into the kingâ\\x80\\x99s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\\r\\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\\r\\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\\r\\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\\r\\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\\r\\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\\r\\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\\r\\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\\r\\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: â\\x80\\x98I have eaten a\\r\\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\\r\\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\\r\\ndie of hunger.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: â\\x80\\x98Get up and come with me; you shall\\r\\neat yourself full.â\\x80\\x99 He led him to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s palace where all the\\r\\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\\r\\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\\r\\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\\r\\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\\r\\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\\r\\nwater. â\\x80\\x98As soon as you come sailing back in it,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98you shall\\r\\nhave my daughter for wife.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\\r\\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\\r\\nhe said: â\\x80\\x98Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\\r\\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.â\\x80\\x99 Then he\\r\\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\\r\\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\\r\\nwedding was celebrated, and after the kingâ\\x80\\x99s death, Dummling inherited\\r\\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\\r\\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\\r\\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\\r\\nat their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sickness; and as they were walking together very\\r\\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\\r\\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\\r\\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. â\\x80\\x98I know what would,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the little old man; â\\x80\\x98it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\\r\\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nthe eldest son said, â\\x80\\x98I will soon find itâ\\x80\\x99: and he went to the sick\\r\\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\\r\\nit was the only thing that could save him. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the king. â\\x80\\x98I had\\r\\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\\r\\nyour journey.â\\x80\\x99 But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\\r\\nprince thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98If I bring my father this water, he will\\r\\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\\r\\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\\r\\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\\r\\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Prince, whither so fast?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What is that to thee, you ugly imp?â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\\r\\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\\r\\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\\r\\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\\r\\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\\r\\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\\r\\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\\r\\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\\r\\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his sonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nreturn, till at last the second son said, â\\x80\\x98Father, I will go in search\\r\\nof the Water of Life.â\\x80\\x99 For he thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98My brother is surely\\r\\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.â\\x80\\x99 The king was\\r\\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\\r\\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\\r\\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\\r\\nmountains, saying, as before, â\\x80\\x98Prince, prince, whither so fast?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Mind\\r\\nyour own affairs, busybody!â\\x80\\x99 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\\r\\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\\r\\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\\r\\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\\r\\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\\r\\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\\r\\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Prince, whither so fast?â\\x80\\x99 And the prince said, â\\x80\\x98I am going in\\r\\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\\r\\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Do you know\\r\\nwhere it is to be found?â\\x80\\x99 asked the dwarf. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the prince, â\\x80\\x98I do\\r\\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\\r\\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\\r\\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\\r\\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\\r\\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\\r\\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\\r\\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\\r\\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\\r\\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\\r\\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\\r\\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\\r\\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end, and\\r\\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\\r\\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\\r\\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\\r\\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\\r\\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\\r\\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\\r\\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\\r\\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\\r\\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\\r\\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\\r\\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\\r\\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\\r\\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\\r\\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\\r\\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\\r\\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\\r\\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\\r\\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\\r\\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\\r\\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\\r\\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\\r\\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\\r\\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, â\\x80\\x98You\\r\\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\\r\\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.â\\x80\\x99 Then the prince thought\\r\\nto himself, â\\x80\\x98I cannot go home to my father without my brothersâ\\x80\\x99; so he\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\\r\\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,â\\x80\\x99 said the dwarf,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\\r\\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, â\\x80\\x98Beware of them, for they have\\r\\nbad hearts.â\\x80\\x99 Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\\r\\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\\r\\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\\r\\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\\r\\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\\r\\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\\r\\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\\r\\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\\r\\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s army with it; and thus the\\r\\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\\r\\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\\r\\nthe two eldest said to themselves, â\\x80\\x98Our brother has got the water which\\r\\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\\r\\nkingdom, which is our rightâ\\x80\\x99; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\\r\\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\\r\\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\\r\\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to their journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end, the youngest son brought his cup\\r\\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\\r\\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\\r\\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\\r\\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\\r\\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\\r\\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\\r\\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\\r\\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Well,\\r\\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\\r\\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\\r\\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\\r\\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\\r\\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\\r\\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\\r\\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\\r\\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\\r\\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\\r\\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\\r\\nday, when the kingâ\\x80\\x99s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\\r\\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\\r\\nthe prince said, â\\x80\\x98My friend, what is the matter with you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I cannot and\\r\\ndare not tell you,â\\x80\\x99 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\\r\\nforgive you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said the huntsman; â\\x80\\x98the king has ordered me to\\r\\nshoot you.â\\x80\\x99 The prince started at this, and said, â\\x80\\x98Let me live, and I\\r\\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\\r\\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98With all my heart,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe huntsman; â\\x80\\x98I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\\r\\nhave shot you.â\\x80\\x99 Then he took the princeâ\\x80\\x99s coat, and gave him the shabby\\r\\none, and went away through the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old kingâ\\x80\\x99s court,\\r\\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\\r\\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\\r\\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\\r\\npeople. This touched the old kingâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and he thought his son might\\r\\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, â\\x80\\x98O that my son were still\\r\\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98He is still alive,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the huntsman; â\\x80\\x98and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\\r\\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.â\\x80\\x99 At this the king was\\r\\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\\r\\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\\r\\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\\r\\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\\r\\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\\r\\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\\r\\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\\r\\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\\r\\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\\r\\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\\r\\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98It is a pity to ride upon this\\r\\nbeautiful roadâ\\x80\\x99; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\\r\\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\\r\\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\\r\\nabout his business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\\r\\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\\r\\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\\r\\nhimself, â\\x80\\x98What a pity it is that anything should tread here!â\\x80\\x99 Then he\\r\\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\\r\\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\\r\\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\\r\\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s anger, and set out in\\r\\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\\r\\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\\r\\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\\r\\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\\r\\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\\r\\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\\r\\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\\r\\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\\r\\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\\r\\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\\r\\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\\r\\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\\r\\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\\r\\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\\r\\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\\r\\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\\r\\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\\r\\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\\r\\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\\r\\n  And feasted and frolickâ\\x80\\x99d I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell how long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a kingâ\\x80\\x99s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\\r\\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\\r\\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\\r\\nThen he said to his beloved: â\\x80\\x98I must now go and leave you, I give you\\r\\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99 So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\\r\\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: â\\x80\\x98Dear son, I wished\\r\\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nhe named a certain kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\\r\\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: â\\x80\\x98Yes,\\r\\ndear father, your will shall be done,â\\x80\\x99 and thereupon the king shut his\\r\\neyes, and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\\r\\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\\r\\nhis father, and caused the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\\r\\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\\r\\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\\r\\nsaid to her: â\\x80\\x98Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\\r\\nwhatsoever you will.â\\x80\\x99 She thought for a moment and said: â\\x80\\x98Dear father,\\r\\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe father said: â\\x80\\x98If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\\r\\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\\r\\nfigure, and size.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, she had twelve suits of\\r\\nhuntsmenâ\\x80\\x99s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\\r\\non the huntsmenâ\\x80\\x99s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\\r\\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\\r\\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\\r\\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\\r\\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\\r\\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 and that he would\\r\\nwillingly take them, and now they were the kingâ\\x80\\x99s twelve huntsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\\r\\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\\r\\nsaid to the king: â\\x80\\x98You think you have twelve huntsmen?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nking, â\\x80\\x98they are twelve huntsmen.â\\x80\\x99 The lion continued: â\\x80\\x98You are mistaken,\\r\\nthey are twelve girls.â\\x80\\x99 The king said: â\\x80\\x98That cannot be true! How\\r\\nwill you prove that to me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\\r\\nante-chamber,â\\x80\\x99 answered the lion, â\\x80\\x98and then you will soon see. Men have\\r\\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\\r\\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.â\\x80\\x99 The king\\r\\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, however, a servant of the kingâ\\x80\\x99s who favoured the huntsmen,\\r\\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\\r\\nthem and repeated everything, and said: â\\x80\\x98The lion wants to make the king\\r\\nbelieve that you are girls.â\\x80\\x99 Then the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter thanked him, and\\r\\nsaid to her maidens: â\\x80\\x98Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\\r\\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\\r\\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\\r\\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\\r\\nand the king said to the lion: â\\x80\\x98You have lied to me, they walk just like\\r\\nmen.â\\x80\\x99 The lion said: â\\x80\\x98They have been informed that they were going to\\r\\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\\r\\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\\r\\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\\r\\nante-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\\r\\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter\\r\\nsaid to her eleven girls: â\\x80\\x98Show some constraint, and do not look round\\r\\nat the spinning-wheels.â\\x80\\x99 And next morning when the king had his twelve\\r\\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\\r\\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\\r\\nspinning-wheels.â\\x80\\x99 The lion replied: â\\x80\\x98They have restrained themselves.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\\r\\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\\r\\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the kingâ\\x80\\x99s bride was\\r\\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\\r\\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\\r\\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\\r\\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\\r\\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\\r\\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\\r\\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: â\\x80\\x98You are mine, and I am yours, and\\r\\nno one in the world can alter that.â\\x80\\x99 He sent a messenger to the other\\r\\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\\r\\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\\r\\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\\r\\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\\r\\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\\r\\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\\r\\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\\r\\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\\r\\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\\r\\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\\r\\nhis trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\\r\\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\\r\\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\\r\\nblack dwarf. â\\x80\\x98Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?â\\x80\\x99 said he to the\\r\\nmerchant; â\\x80\\x98what is it you take so deeply to heart?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If you would do me\\r\\nany good I would willingly tell you,â\\x80\\x99 said the merchant. â\\x80\\x98Who knows but\\r\\nI may?â\\x80\\x99 said the little man: â\\x80\\x98tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\\r\\nwill find I may be of some use.â\\x80\\x99 Then the merchant told him how all his\\r\\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\\r\\nbut that little plot of land. â\\x80\\x98Oh, trouble not yourself about that,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the dwarf; â\\x80\\x98only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\\r\\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\\r\\nas you please.â\\x80\\x99 The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\\r\\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\\r\\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\\r\\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\\r\\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\\r\\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\\r\\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\\r\\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\\r\\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\\r\\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\\r\\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\\r\\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\\r\\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\\r\\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\\r\\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\\r\\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\\r\\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\\r\\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\\r\\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\\r\\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\\r\\ntoo much for the little man.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\\r\\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\\r\\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\\r\\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\\r\\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\\r\\nlast the boy said to him. â\\x80\\x98Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\\r\\nwhat do you want?â\\x80\\x99 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\\r\\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\\r\\ngood luck was in store for him. â\\x80\\x98Have you brought me what you said you\\r\\nwould?â\\x80\\x99 said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\\r\\nHeinel said again, â\\x80\\x98What do you want here?â\\x80\\x99 The dwarf said, â\\x80\\x98I come to\\r\\ntalk with your father, not with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You have cheated and taken in my\\r\\nfather,â\\x80\\x99 said the son; â\\x80\\x98pray give him up his bond at once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Fair and\\r\\nsoftly,â\\x80\\x99 said the little old man; â\\x80\\x98right is right; I have paid my money,\\r\\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\\r\\nhave what I paid it for.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You must have my consent to that first,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nHeinel, â\\x80\\x98so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.â\\x80\\x99 The old\\r\\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\\r\\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\\r\\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\\r\\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\\r\\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\\r\\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\\r\\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\\r\\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\\r\\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\\r\\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\\r\\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\\r\\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\\r\\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\\r\\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\\r\\nany rate he had had his revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\\r\\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\\r\\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\\r\\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\\r\\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. â\\x80\\x98Here,â\\x80\\x99 said he to\\r\\nhimself, â\\x80\\x98must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.â\\x80\\x99 So he once\\r\\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\\r\\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\\r\\nto see him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\\r\\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\\r\\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\\r\\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\\r\\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\\r\\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\\r\\nspeak not a word, and at twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock they must go away. The second\\r\\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\\r\\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\\r\\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\\r\\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\\r\\nand health.â\\x80\\x99 And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\\r\\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\\r\\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\\r\\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\\r\\nMountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\\r\\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\\r\\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\\r\\nagainst his going, and said, â\\x80\\x98I know well that misfortunes will come\\r\\nupon us if you go.â\\x80\\x99 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\\r\\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, â\\x80\\x98Take this ring, and\\r\\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\\r\\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\\r\\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\\r\\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\\r\\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\\r\\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\\r\\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\\r\\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\\r\\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\\r\\nhe was his son, and said, â\\x80\\x98Is there no mark by which you would know me\\r\\nif I am really your son?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said his mother, â\\x80\\x98our Heinel had a mark\\r\\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.â\\x80\\x99 Then he showed them the mark, and\\r\\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\\r\\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\\r\\nabout in a shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s frock!â\\x80\\x99 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\\r\\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\\r\\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\\r\\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\\r\\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\\r\\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\\r\\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\\r\\nhimself down, and said, â\\x80\\x98I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\\r\\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.â\\x80\\x99 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\\r\\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\\r\\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\\r\\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I can never go back to my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98they would say I\\r\\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\\r\\nmy kingdom.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\\r\\ngiants were sharing their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s goods; and as they saw him pass they\\r\\ncried out and said, â\\x80\\x98Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\\r\\nbetween us.â\\x80\\x99 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemyâ\\x80\\x99s head whenever\\r\\nthe wearer gave the words, â\\x80\\x98Heads off!â\\x80\\x99; a cloak that made the owner\\r\\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\\r\\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\\r\\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\\r\\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\\r\\nand in a moment he was a fly. â\\x80\\x98The cloak is very well,â\\x80\\x99 said he: â\\x80\\x98now\\r\\ngive me the sword.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said they; â\\x80\\x98not unless you undertake not to\\r\\nsay, â\\x80\\x9cHeads off!â\\x80\\x9d for if you do we are all dead men.â\\x80\\x99 So they gave it\\r\\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\\r\\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\\r\\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\\r\\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\\r\\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\\r\\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\\r\\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\\r\\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\\r\\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\\r\\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\\r\\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\\r\\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nshe to herself, â\\x80\\x98was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\\r\\nstill seem to bind me?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98False and fickle one!â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98One indeed came who set thee free, and\\r\\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\\r\\nhave had such treatment from thee?â\\x80\\x99 Then he went out and sent away the\\r\\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\\r\\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\\r\\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\\r\\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\\r\\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. â\\x80\\x98Heads Off!â\\x80\\x99 cried he; and with the\\r\\nword the traitorsâ\\x80\\x99 heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\\r\\nof the Golden Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\\r\\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\\r\\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\\r\\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\\r\\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\\r\\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the doctor,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98that is soon managed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What must I do?â\\x80\\x99 asked the peasant. â\\x80\\x98In the\\r\\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\\r\\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\\r\\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\\r\\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nam Doctor Knowall,â\\x80\\x9d and have that nailed up above your house-door.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\\r\\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\\r\\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\\r\\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\\r\\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\\r\\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\\r\\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes, but Grete, my\\r\\nwife, must go too.â\\x80\\x99 The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\\r\\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\\r\\nto the noblemanâ\\x80\\x99s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\\r\\nsit down and eat. â\\x80\\x98Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and he seated\\r\\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\\r\\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: â\\x80\\x98Grete,\\r\\nthat was the first,â\\x80\\x99 meaning that was the servant who brought the first\\r\\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: â\\x80\\x98That is\\r\\nthe first thief,â\\x80\\x99 and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\\r\\nto his comrade outside: â\\x80\\x98The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\\r\\nsaid I was the first.â\\x80\\x99 The second did not want to go in at all, but was\\r\\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\\r\\nand said: â\\x80\\x98Grete, that is the second.â\\x80\\x99 This servant was equally alarmed,\\r\\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\\r\\npeasant again said: â\\x80\\x98Grete, that is the third.â\\x80\\x99 The fourth had to carry\\r\\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\\r\\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\\r\\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\\r\\ncried: â\\x80\\x98Ah, poor Crabb.â\\x80\\x99 When the lord heard that, he cried: â\\x80\\x98There! he\\r\\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\\r\\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\\r\\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\\r\\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\\r\\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\\r\\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\\r\\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\\r\\nsat down to the table, and said: â\\x80\\x98My lord, now will I search in my book\\r\\nwhere the gold is hidden.â\\x80\\x99 The fifth servant, however, crept into the\\r\\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\\r\\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\\r\\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!â\\x80\\x99 Then the fellow in the\\r\\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\\r\\ncrying: â\\x80\\x98That man knows everything!â\\x80\\x99 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\\r\\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\\r\\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\\r\\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\\r\\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\\r\\nchristened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\\r\\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\\r\\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\\r\\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\\r\\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\\r\\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\\r\\nyoung men stay so long. â\\x80\\x98Surely,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98the whole seven must have\\r\\nforgotten themselves over some game of playâ\\x80\\x99; and when he had waited\\r\\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\\r\\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\\r\\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\\r\\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\\r\\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\\r\\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\\r\\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\\r\\nmore beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\\r\\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\\r\\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthey, â\\x80\\x98she is beautiful indeed, but still â\\x80\\x98tis a pity that her brothers\\r\\nshould have been lost for her sake.â\\x80\\x99 Then she was much grieved, and went\\r\\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\\r\\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\\r\\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\\r\\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\\r\\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\\r\\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\\r\\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\\r\\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\\r\\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\\r\\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\\r\\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\\r\\njourneyed till she came to the worldâ\\x80\\x99s end; then she came to the sun,\\r\\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\\r\\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, â\\x80\\x98I smell flesh\\r\\nand blood this way!â\\x80\\x99 so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\\r\\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\\r\\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\\r\\nlittle piece of wood, and said, â\\x80\\x98If you have not this little piece of\\r\\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\\r\\nand there your brothers live.â\\x80\\x99 The little girl took the piece of wood,\\r\\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\\r\\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\\r\\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\\r\\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\\r\\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\\r\\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\\r\\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\\r\\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, â\\x80\\x98What are you\\r\\nseeking for?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,â\\x80\\x99 answered she.\\r\\nThen the dwarf said, â\\x80\\x98My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\\r\\ntill they come, pray step in.â\\x80\\x99 Now the little dwarf was getting their\\r\\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\\r\\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\\r\\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\\r\\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\\r\\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\\r\\ndwarf said, â\\x80\\x98Here come my masters.â\\x80\\x99 When they came in, they wanted to\\r\\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\\r\\none after the other,\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\\r\\nlittle glass?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Caw! Caw! well I ween\\r\\n  Mortal lips have this way been.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\\r\\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s and motherâ\\x80\\x99s,\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\\r\\nfree.â\\x80\\x99 When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\\r\\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\\r\\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\\r\\nother, and went merrily home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\\r\\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\\r\\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\\r\\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\\r\\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\\r\\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\\r\\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\\r\\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98What may you be about, Miss Cat?\\r\\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98I am not sleeping, I am waking,\\r\\n  Would you know what I am making?\\r\\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest for supper?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, thank you, miss,â\\x80\\x99 said the fox, â\\x80\\x98what is Mrs Fox doing?â\\x80\\x99 The maid\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98She is sitting in her room,\\r\\n  Moaning in her gloom,\\r\\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\\r\\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\\r\\nher.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Certainly, young sir.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\\r\\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Mistress Fox, are you inside?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Oh, yes, my little cat,â\\x80\\x99 she cried.\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98A wooer he stands at the door out there.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98What does he look like, my dear?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, no,â\\x80\\x99 answered\\r\\nthe cat, â\\x80\\x98he has only one.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then I will not have him.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\\r\\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\\r\\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\\r\\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\\r\\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\\r\\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Now open the gates and doors all wide,\\r\\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\\r\\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\\r\\nFox out of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\\r\\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\\r\\nwolf greeted her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\\r\\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\\r\\n  What are you making good?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98In milk Iâ\\x80\\x99m breaking bread so sweet,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, thank you, Mrs Cat,â\\x80\\x99 answered the wolf. â\\x80\\x98Is Mrs Fox not at home?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat said:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98She sits upstairs in her room,\\r\\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\\r\\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\\r\\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98If sheâ\\x80\\x99s in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please her to step below?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\\r\\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\\r\\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\\r\\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\\r\\n  If youâ\\x80\\x99re in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please you to step below?\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Fox asked: â\\x80\\x98Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\\r\\nmouth?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 answered the cat. â\\x80\\x98Then he wonâ\\x80\\x99t do for me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\\r\\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\\r\\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\\r\\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: â\\x80\\x98Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\\r\\nlittle pointed mouth?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the cat, â\\x80\\x98he has.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then let him come\\r\\nupstairs,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\\r\\nfeast.\\r\\n\\r\\n â\\x80\\x98Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\\r\\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\\r\\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\\r\\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\\r\\n  But ate up every one he caught.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\\r\\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SALAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\\r\\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, â\\x80\\x98Good day, good day;\\r\\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\\r\\nsomething to eat.â\\x80\\x99 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\\r\\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\\r\\nshe took hold of him, and said, â\\x80\\x98Listen, my friend, to what I am going\\r\\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\\r\\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\\r\\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\\r\\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\\r\\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\\r\\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\\r\\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\\r\\nis the birdâ\\x80\\x99s heart that will bring you this good luck.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98If all this does\\r\\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.â\\x80\\x99 When he had gone a hundred\\r\\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\\r\\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\\r\\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\\r\\neach wished to have it himself. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the huntsman, â\\x80\\x98this is\\r\\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman saidâ\\x80\\x99; then he shot into\\r\\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\\r\\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\\r\\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\\r\\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\\r\\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\\r\\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\\r\\nat last thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\\r\\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\\r\\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\\r\\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\\r\\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\\r\\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\\r\\nsaid to the young lady, â\\x80\\x98There is a young man coming out of the wood who\\r\\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\\r\\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a birdâ\\x80\\x99s heart that\\r\\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.â\\x80\\x99 Meantime the\\r\\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\\r\\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I wantâ\\x80\\x99;\\r\\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\\r\\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\\r\\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\\r\\nbut looking at the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\\r\\nThen the old woman said, â\\x80\\x98Now is the time for getting the birdâ\\x80\\x99s heart.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\\r\\npillow, for it lay now under the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s, and the old woman took it\\r\\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\\r\\nprize.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the old witch, â\\x80\\x98we have got the birdâ\\x80\\x99s heart, but not the\\r\\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Let us leave him that,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the young lady; â\\x80\\x98he has already lost his wealth.â\\x80\\x99 Then the witch\\r\\nwas very angry, and said, â\\x80\\x98Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\\r\\nthing, and I must and will have it.â\\x80\\x99 So she did as the old woman told\\r\\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\\r\\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, â\\x80\\x98What makes you so sad?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Alas! dear sir,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98yonder lies the granite rock where all the\\r\\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\\r\\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\\r\\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If thatâ\\x80\\x99s all your grief,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nthe huntsman, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take you there with all my heartâ\\x80\\x99; so he drew her under\\r\\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\\r\\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\\r\\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\\r\\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, â\\x80\\x98Let us\\r\\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\\r\\nany longer.â\\x80\\x99 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\\r\\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\\r\\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\\r\\nherself home again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\\r\\nalone on the wild rock, he said, â\\x80\\x98Alas! what roguery there is in the\\r\\nworld!â\\x80\\x99 and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\\r\\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\\r\\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98I can only\\r\\nsave myself by feigning to be asleepâ\\x80\\x99; so he laid himself down as if he\\r\\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\\r\\nhim with his foot, and said, â\\x80\\x98What worm is this that lies here curled\\r\\nup?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tread upon him and kill him,â\\x80\\x99 said the second. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s not worth the\\r\\ntrouble,â\\x80\\x99 said the third; â\\x80\\x98let him live, heâ\\x80\\x99ll go climbing higher up the\\r\\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.â\\x80\\x99 And they\\r\\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\\r\\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\\r\\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\\r\\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\\r\\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked around him, and said, â\\x80\\x98I wish I had something to eat, if\\r\\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\\r\\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.â\\x80\\x99 At last he\\r\\nthought to himself, â\\x80\\x98I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x99 So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\\r\\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\\r\\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\\r\\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\\r\\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\\r\\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\\r\\nhave found his old shape again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\\r\\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, â\\x80\\x98This will help me to my fortune\\r\\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.â\\x80\\x99 So he\\r\\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\\r\\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\\r\\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\\r\\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; â\\x80\\x98I am so tired,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98that I\\r\\ncan go no farther.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Countryman,â\\x80\\x99 said the witch, â\\x80\\x98who are you? and what\\r\\nis your business?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98a messenger sent by the king to\\r\\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\\r\\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I can carry\\r\\nit farther.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\\r\\nlonged to taste it, and said, â\\x80\\x98Dear countryman, let us just taste it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98To be sure,â\\x80\\x99 answered he; â\\x80\\x98I have two heads of it with me, and will\\r\\ngive you oneâ\\x80\\x99; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\\r\\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\\r\\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\\r\\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\\r\\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\\r\\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\\r\\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\\r\\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\\r\\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\\r\\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\\r\\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\\r\\nlonged to taste it, she said, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where the salad can be.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, â\\x80\\x98I will go\\r\\ninto the kitchen and see.â\\x80\\x99 And as he went he saw two asses in the court\\r\\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. â\\x80\\x98All right!â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nhe; â\\x80\\x98those two have had their share.â\\x80\\x99 Then he took up the rest of\\r\\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\\r\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x98I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\\r\\nmight know him. â\\x80\\x98Now you shall be paid for your roguery,â\\x80\\x99 said he; and\\r\\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\\r\\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nmiller. â\\x80\\x98I have three tiresome beasts here,â\\x80\\x99 said the other; â\\x80\\x98if you\\r\\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\\r\\nI will pay you whatever you ask.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98With all my heart,â\\x80\\x99 said the miller;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98but how shall I treat them?â\\x80\\x99 Then the huntsman said, â\\x80\\x98Give the old\\r\\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\\r\\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\\r\\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\\r\\nno stripesâ\\x80\\x99: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\\r\\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\\r\\nwanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\\r\\nwas dead; â\\x80\\x98The other two,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98are alive and eat, but are so\\r\\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.â\\x80\\x99 Then the huntsman pitied them,\\r\\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\\r\\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\\r\\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, â\\x80\\x98O dearest huntsman! forgive\\r\\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\\r\\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\\r\\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the birdâ\\x80\\x99s heart, I will give it you\\r\\ntoo.â\\x80\\x99 But he said, â\\x80\\x98Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\\r\\nto make you my wife.â\\x80\\x99 So they were married, and lived together very\\r\\nhappily till they died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\\r\\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\\r\\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!â\\x80\\x99 When anything\\r\\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\\r\\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\\r\\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\\r\\nplace, he answered: â\\x80\\x98Oh, no father, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not go there, it makes me\\r\\nshudder!â\\x80\\x99 for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\\r\\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: â\\x80\\x98Oh,\\r\\nit makes us shudder!â\\x80\\x99 The younger sat in a corner and listened with\\r\\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. â\\x80\\x98They are\\r\\nalways saying: â\\x80\\x9cIt makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!â\\x80\\x9d It does not\\r\\nmake me shudder,â\\x80\\x99 thought he. â\\x80\\x98That, too, must be an art of which I\\r\\nunderstand nothing!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: â\\x80\\x98Hearken to me,\\r\\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\\r\\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\\r\\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, father,â\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x98I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\\r\\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand\\r\\nthat at all yet.â\\x80\\x99 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\\r\\nthought to himself: â\\x80\\x98Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\\r\\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\\r\\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father sighed, and answered him: â\\x80\\x98You shall soon learn what it is to\\r\\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\\r\\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\\r\\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. â\\x80\\x98Just think,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x98when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\\r\\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If that be all,â\\x80\\x99 replied the\\r\\nsexton, â\\x80\\x98he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\\r\\npolish him.â\\x80\\x99 The father was glad to do it, for he thought: â\\x80\\x98It will\\r\\ntrain the boy a little.â\\x80\\x99 The sexton therefore took him into his house,\\r\\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\\r\\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\\r\\nring the bell. â\\x80\\x98You shall soon learn what shuddering is,â\\x80\\x99 thought he,\\r\\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\\r\\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\\r\\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\\r\\nhole. â\\x80\\x98Who is there?â\\x80\\x99 cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\\r\\nnot move or stir. â\\x80\\x98Give an answer,â\\x80\\x99 cried the boy, â\\x80\\x98or take yourself\\r\\noff, you have no business here at night.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\\r\\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: â\\x80\\x98What do you want\\r\\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\\r\\nsteps!â\\x80\\x99 The sexton thought: â\\x80\\x98He canâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be as bad as his words,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\\r\\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\\r\\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\\r\\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\\r\\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\\r\\nfell asleep. The sextonâ\\x80\\x99s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\\r\\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\\r\\nand asked: â\\x80\\x98Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\\r\\nbefore you did.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 replied the boy, â\\x80\\x98but someone was\\r\\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\\r\\nwould neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\\r\\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\\r\\nI should be sorry if it were.â\\x80\\x99 The woman ran away and found her husband,\\r\\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\\r\\nboyâ\\x80\\x99s father, â\\x80\\x98Your boy,â\\x80\\x99 cried she, â\\x80\\x98has been the cause of a great\\r\\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\\r\\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.â\\x80\\x99 The father was\\r\\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. â\\x80\\x98What wicked tricks\\r\\nare these?â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98The devil must have put them into your head.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Father,â\\x80\\x99 he replied, â\\x80\\x98do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\\r\\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\\r\\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\\r\\naway.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 said the father, â\\x80\\x98I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\\r\\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\\r\\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\\r\\nunderstand one art which will support me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Learn what you will,â\\x80\\x99 spoke\\r\\nthe father, â\\x80\\x98it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\\r\\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\\r\\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\\r\\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\\r\\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\\r\\nhimself: â\\x80\\x98If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!â\\x80\\x99 Then a man\\r\\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\\r\\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\\r\\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: â\\x80\\x98Look, there is the tree where\\r\\nseven men have married the ropemakerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and are now learning\\r\\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\\r\\nsoon learn how to shudder.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If that is all that is wanted,â\\x80\\x99 answered\\r\\nthe youth, â\\x80\\x98it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\\r\\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\\r\\nmorning.â\\x80\\x99 Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\\r\\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\\r\\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\\r\\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\\r\\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\\r\\nsuffer!â\\x80\\x99 And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\\r\\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\\r\\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\\r\\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\\r\\ntheir clothes. So he said: â\\x80\\x98Take care, or I will hang you up again.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\\r\\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: â\\x80\\x98If you will not\\r\\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,â\\x80\\x99 and he hung\\r\\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\\r\\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\\r\\nthe fifty talers, and said: â\\x80\\x98Well do you know how to shudder?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nanswered he, â\\x80\\x98how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\\r\\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\\r\\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.â\\x80\\x99 Then the man saw that he would not\\r\\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: â\\x80\\x98Such a youth has\\r\\nnever come my way before.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\\r\\nhimself: â\\x80\\x98Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!â\\x80\\x99 A\\r\\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: â\\x80\\x98Who are\\r\\nyou?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: â\\x80\\x98From\\r\\nwhence do you come?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I know not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Who is your father?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That I may\\r\\nnot tell you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What is it that you are always muttering between your\\r\\nteeth?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 replied the youth, â\\x80\\x98I do so wish I could shudder, but\\r\\nno one can teach me how.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Enough of your foolish chatter,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nwaggoner. â\\x80\\x98Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\\r\\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\\r\\nthe youth again said quite loudly: â\\x80\\x98If I could but shudder! If I could\\r\\nbut shudder!â\\x80\\x99 The host who heard this, laughed and said: â\\x80\\x98If that is\\r\\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\r\\nbe silent,â\\x80\\x99 said the hostess, â\\x80\\x98so many prying persons have already lost\\r\\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\\r\\nthese should never see the daylight again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the youth said: â\\x80\\x98However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\\r\\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.â\\x80\\x99 He let the host have\\r\\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\\r\\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\\r\\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\\r\\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\\r\\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\\r\\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\\r\\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\\r\\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\\r\\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: â\\x80\\x98If it be allowed, I will\\r\\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: â\\x80\\x98You may\\r\\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\\r\\nbe things without life.â\\x80\\x99 Then he answered: â\\x80\\x98Then I ask for a fire, a\\r\\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\\r\\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\\r\\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\\r\\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. â\\x80\\x98Ah, if I could\\r\\nbut shudder!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but I shall not learn it here either.â\\x80\\x99 Towards\\r\\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\\r\\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: â\\x80\\x98Au, miau! how cold we are!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You fools!â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\\r\\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.â\\x80\\x99 And when he had said\\r\\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\\r\\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\\r\\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why not?â\\x80\\x99 he replied, â\\x80\\x98but\\r\\njust show me your paws.â\\x80\\x99 Then they stretched out their claws. â\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x98what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\\r\\nand screwed their feet fast. â\\x80\\x98I have looked at your fingers,â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98and my fancy for card-playing has gone,â\\x80\\x99 and he struck them dead and\\r\\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\\r\\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\\r\\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\\r\\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\\r\\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\\r\\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\\r\\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: â\\x80\\x98Away with you,\\r\\nvermin,â\\x80\\x99 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\\r\\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\\r\\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\\r\\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\\r\\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. â\\x80\\x98That is the very thing\\r\\nfor me,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\\r\\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\\r\\nthe whole of the castle. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but go faster.â\\x80\\x99 Then\\r\\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\\r\\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\\r\\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\\r\\nin the air, got out and said: â\\x80\\x98Now anyone who likes, may drive,â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\\r\\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\\r\\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: â\\x80\\x98After all it is a\\r\\npity,--for so handsome a man.â\\x80\\x99 The youth heard it, got up, and said: â\\x80\\x98It\\r\\nhas not come to that yet.â\\x80\\x99 Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\\r\\nand asked how he had fared. â\\x80\\x98Very well indeed,â\\x80\\x99 answered he; â\\x80\\x98one\\r\\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.â\\x80\\x99 Then he went to the\\r\\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: â\\x80\\x98I never expected to\\r\\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\\r\\nfire, and once more began his old song: â\\x80\\x98If I could but shudder!â\\x80\\x99 When\\r\\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\\r\\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\\r\\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\\r\\nchimney and fell before him. â\\x80\\x98Hullo!â\\x80\\x99 cried he, â\\x80\\x98another half belongs\\r\\nto this. This is not enough!â\\x80\\x99 Then the uproar began again, there was a\\r\\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. â\\x80\\x98Wait,â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x98I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.â\\x80\\x99 When he had done\\r\\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\\r\\nhideous man was sitting in his place. â\\x80\\x98That is no part of our bargain,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the youth, â\\x80\\x98the bench is mine.â\\x80\\x99 The man wanted to push him away;\\r\\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\\r\\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\\r\\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead menâ\\x80\\x99s legs\\r\\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\\r\\nyouth also wanted to play and said: â\\x80\\x98Listen you, can I join you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,\\r\\nif you have any money.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Money enough,â\\x80\\x99 replied he, â\\x80\\x98but your balls are\\r\\nnot quite round.â\\x80\\x99 Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\\r\\nturned them till they were round. â\\x80\\x98There, now they will roll better!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid he. â\\x80\\x98Hurrah! now weâ\\x80\\x99ll have fun!â\\x80\\x99 He played with them and lost some\\r\\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\\r\\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\\r\\nto inquire after him. â\\x80\\x98How has it fared with you this time?â\\x80\\x99 asked he.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have been playing at nine-pins,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, â\\x80\\x98and have lost a couple\\r\\nof farthings.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Have you not shuddered then?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98If I could but shudder.â\\x80\\x99 When it grew late, six tall men came in and\\r\\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: â\\x80\\x98Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\\r\\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,â\\x80\\x99 and he beckoned with his finger,\\r\\nand cried: â\\x80\\x98Come, little cousin, come.â\\x80\\x99 They placed the coffin on the\\r\\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\\r\\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. â\\x80\\x98Wait,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nwill warm you a little,â\\x80\\x99 and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\\r\\nlaid it on the dead manâ\\x80\\x99s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\\r\\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\\r\\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\\r\\nthought to himself: â\\x80\\x98When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\\r\\nother,â\\x80\\x99 and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\\r\\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\\r\\nThen said the youth, â\\x80\\x98See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\ndead man, however, got up and cried: â\\x80\\x98Now will I strangle you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\\r\\ninto your coffin again,â\\x80\\x99 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\\r\\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. â\\x80\\x98I cannot\\r\\nmanage to shudder,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98I shall never learn it here as long as I\\r\\nlive.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\\r\\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. â\\x80\\x98You wretch,â\\x80\\x99 cried he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not so\\r\\nfast,â\\x80\\x99 replied the youth. â\\x80\\x98If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\\r\\nin it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I will soon seize you,â\\x80\\x99 said the fiend. â\\x80\\x98Softly, softly, do not\\r\\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98We shall see,â\\x80\\x99 said the old man. â\\x80\\x98If you are stronger, I will let you\\r\\ngo--come, we will try.â\\x80\\x99 Then he led him by dark passages to a smithâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I can do better than that,â\\x80\\x99 said the youth, and went to the other\\r\\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\\r\\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\\r\\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old manâ\\x80\\x99s beard. â\\x80\\x98Now I have you,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid the youth. â\\x80\\x98Now it is your turn to die.â\\x80\\x99 Then he seized an iron bar\\r\\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\\r\\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\\r\\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\\r\\nthree chests full of gold. â\\x80\\x98Of these,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98one part is for the\\r\\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.â\\x80\\x99 In the meantime it\\r\\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\\r\\ndarkness. â\\x80\\x98I shall still be able to find my way out,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and felt\\r\\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\\r\\nNext morning the king came and said: â\\x80\\x98Now you must have learnt what\\r\\nshuddering is?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 he answered; â\\x80\\x98what can it be? My dead cousin was\\r\\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\\r\\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nking, â\\x80\\x98you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That\\r\\nis all very well,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but still I do not know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\\r\\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\\r\\nsaid always: â\\x80\\x98If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.â\\x80\\x99 And this\\r\\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: â\\x80\\x98I will find a cure for him;\\r\\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.â\\x80\\x99 She went out to the stream\\r\\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\\r\\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\\r\\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\\r\\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\\r\\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: â\\x80\\x98Oh, what makes me shudder\\r\\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\\r\\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\\r\\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\\r\\nonly made sport of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\\r\\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\\r\\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\\r\\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\\r\\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nas round as a tub,â\\x80\\x99 said she. The next was too tall: â\\x80\\x98What a maypole!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsaid she. The next was too short: â\\x80\\x98What a dumpling!â\\x80\\x99 said she. The\\r\\nfourth was too pale, and she called him â\\x80\\x98Wallface.â\\x80\\x99 The fifth was too\\r\\nred, so she called him â\\x80\\x98Coxcomb.â\\x80\\x99 The sixth was not straight enough;\\r\\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\\r\\na bakerâ\\x80\\x99s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\\r\\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. â\\x80\\x98Look at\\r\\nhim,â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\\r\\nGrisly-beard.â\\x80\\x99 So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\\r\\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\\r\\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\\r\\ncame to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\\r\\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let him come in.â\\x80\\x99 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\\r\\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\\r\\nking said, â\\x80\\x98You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\\r\\nyour wife.â\\x80\\x99 The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, â\\x80\\x98I have\\r\\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.â\\x80\\x99 So words\\r\\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\\r\\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, â\\x80\\x98Now get ready to\\r\\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\\r\\nto a great wood. â\\x80\\x98Pray,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98whose is this wood?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It belongs\\r\\nto King Grisly-beard,â\\x80\\x99 answered he; â\\x80\\x98hadst thou taken him, all had been\\r\\nthine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99 sighed she; â\\x80\\x98would that I had\\r\\nmarried King Grisly-beard!â\\x80\\x99 Next they came to some fine meadows. â\\x80\\x98Whose\\r\\nare these beautiful green meadows?â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98They belong to King\\r\\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!\\r\\nunlucky wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98would that I had married King\\r\\nGrisly-beard!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to a great city. â\\x80\\x98Whose is this noble city?â\\x80\\x99 said she.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\\r\\nthine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah! wretch that I am!â\\x80\\x99 sighed she; â\\x80\\x98why did I not marry King\\r\\nGrisly-beard?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is no business of mine,â\\x80\\x99 said the fiddler: â\\x80\\x98why\\r\\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they came to a small cottage. â\\x80\\x98What a paltry place!â\\x80\\x99 said she;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98to whom does that little dirty hole belong?â\\x80\\x99 Then the fiddler said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is your and my house, where we are to live.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Where are your\\r\\nservants?â\\x80\\x99 cried she. â\\x80\\x98What do we want with servants?â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98you\\r\\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\\r\\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.â\\x80\\x99 But the princess knew\\r\\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\\r\\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\\r\\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\\r\\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\\r\\ncottage, the man said, â\\x80\\x98Wife, we canâ\\x80\\x99t go on thus, spending money and\\r\\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.â\\x80\\x99 Then he went out and\\r\\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\\r\\nher fingers very sore. â\\x80\\x98I see this work wonâ\\x80\\x99t do,â\\x80\\x99 said he: â\\x80\\x98try and\\r\\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.â\\x80\\x99 So she sat down and tried to\\r\\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. â\\x80\\x98See\\r\\nnow,â\\x80\\x99 said the fiddler, â\\x80\\x98you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\\r\\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try and set up a trade in pots\\r\\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Alas!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsighed she, â\\x80\\x98if any of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s court should pass by and see me\\r\\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\\r\\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\\r\\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\\r\\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\\r\\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\\r\\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\\r\\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\\r\\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\\r\\nand knew not what to do. â\\x80\\x98Ah! what will become of me?â\\x80\\x99 said she; â\\x80\\x98what\\r\\nwill my husband say?â\\x80\\x99 So she ran home and told him all. â\\x80\\x98Who would\\r\\nhave thought you would have been so silly,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98as to put an\\r\\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\\r\\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\\r\\nwork, so I have been to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s palace, and asked if they did not\\r\\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\\r\\nhave plenty to eat.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\\r\\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\\r\\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the kingâ\\x80\\x99s eldest son\\r\\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\\r\\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\\r\\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\\r\\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\\r\\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son in golden\\r\\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\\r\\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\\r\\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\\r\\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\\r\\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\\r\\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\\r\\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\\r\\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\\r\\nbrought her back and said, â\\x80\\x98Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\\r\\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\\r\\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\\r\\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\\r\\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\\r\\ntime to hold our marriage feast.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\\r\\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\\r\\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\\r\\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\\r\\nand I had been of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIRON HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\\r\\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\\r\\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. â\\x80\\x98Perhaps some\\r\\naccident has befallen him,â\\x80\\x99 said the king, and the next day he sent out\\r\\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\\r\\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: â\\x80\\x98Scour\\r\\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\\r\\nthree.â\\x80\\x99 But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\\r\\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\\r\\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\\r\\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\\r\\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\\r\\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\\r\\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: â\\x80\\x98It is not safe in\\r\\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\\r\\nand you would never come out again.â\\x80\\x99 The huntsman replied: â\\x80\\x98Lord, I will\\r\\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\\r\\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\\r\\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\\r\\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\\r\\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\\r\\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\\r\\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\\r\\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\\r\\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\\r\\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\\r\\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\\r\\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\\r\\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\\r\\nforest with safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\\r\\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\\r\\nThe boy ran thither and said: â\\x80\\x98Give me my ball out.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not till you have\\r\\nopened the door for me,â\\x80\\x99 answered the man. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, â\\x80\\x98I will\\r\\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,â\\x80\\x99 and ran away. The next day he\\r\\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: â\\x80\\x98Open my door,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\\r\\nand the boy went once more and said: â\\x80\\x98I cannot open the door even if I\\r\\nwished, for I have not the key.â\\x80\\x99 Then the wild man said: â\\x80\\x98It lies under\\r\\nyour motherâ\\x80\\x99s pillow, you can get it there.â\\x80\\x99 The boy, who wanted to have\\r\\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\\r\\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\\r\\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\\r\\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: â\\x80\\x98Oh,\\r\\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!â\\x80\\x99 The wild man turned\\r\\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\\r\\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\\r\\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\\r\\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\\r\\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\\r\\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\\r\\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\\r\\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: â\\x80\\x98You will never see your father\\r\\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\\r\\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\\r\\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\\r\\nworld.â\\x80\\x99 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\\r\\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: â\\x80\\x98Behold, the gold\\r\\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\\r\\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\\r\\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.â\\x80\\x99 The boy placed\\r\\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\\r\\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\\r\\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\\r\\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\\r\\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\\r\\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\\r\\nlooked at the boy, and said: â\\x80\\x98What has happened to the well?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nothing\\r\\nnothing,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\\r\\nman might not see it. But he said: â\\x80\\x98You have dipped your finger into\\r\\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\\r\\nanything go in.â\\x80\\x99 By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\\r\\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\\r\\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\\r\\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\\r\\nwhat had happened. â\\x80\\x98You have let a hair fall into the well,â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\\r\\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\\r\\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\\r\\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\\r\\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\\r\\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\\r\\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\\r\\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\\r\\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\\r\\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\\r\\nalready knew everything, and said: â\\x80\\x98Take the handkerchief off.â\\x80\\x99 Then the\\r\\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\\r\\nit was of no use. â\\x80\\x98You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\\r\\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\\r\\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\\r\\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\\r\\nforest and cry: â\\x80\\x9cIron Hans,â\\x80\\x9d and then I will come and help you. My\\r\\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\\r\\nabundance.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\\r\\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\\r\\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\\r\\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\\r\\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\\r\\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\\r\\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\\r\\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\\r\\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\\r\\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\\r\\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\\r\\nthe kingâ\\x80\\x99s notice, and he said: â\\x80\\x98When you come to the royal table you\\r\\nmust take your hat off.â\\x80\\x99 He answered: â\\x80\\x98Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\\r\\nsore place on my head.â\\x80\\x99 Then the king had the cook called before him\\r\\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\\r\\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\\r\\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\\r\\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\\r\\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\\r\\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\\r\\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and up she\\r\\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\\r\\nhim: â\\x80\\x98Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.â\\x80\\x99 He put his cap on with all\\r\\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\\r\\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: â\\x80\\x98How\\r\\ncan you take the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\\r\\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh,\\r\\nno,â\\x80\\x99 replied the boy, â\\x80\\x98the wild ones have more scent, and will please\\r\\nher better.â\\x80\\x99 When he got into the room, the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter said: â\\x80\\x98Take\\r\\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.â\\x80\\x99 He again\\r\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98I may not, I have a sore head.â\\x80\\x99 She, however, caught at his\\r\\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\\r\\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\\r\\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\\r\\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\\r\\ngardener, and said: â\\x80\\x98I present them to your children, they can play with\\r\\nthem.â\\x80\\x99 The following day the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter again called to him that he\\r\\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\\r\\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\\r\\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\\r\\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\\r\\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\\r\\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\\r\\nmoney.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\\r\\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\\r\\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\\r\\narmy. Then said the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s boy: â\\x80\\x98I am grown up, and will go to the\\r\\nwars also, only give me a horse.â\\x80\\x99 The others laughed, and said: â\\x80\\x98Seek\\r\\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\\r\\nstable for you.â\\x80\\x99 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\\r\\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\\r\\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\\r\\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called â\\x80\\x98Iron Hansâ\\x80\\x99 three\\r\\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\\r\\nappeared immediately, and said: â\\x80\\x98What do you desire?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I want a strong\\r\\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That you shall have, and still more\\r\\nthan you ask for.â\\x80\\x99 Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\\r\\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\\r\\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\\r\\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\\r\\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\\r\\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\\r\\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\\r\\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\\r\\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\\r\\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\\r\\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\\r\\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\\r\\nHans. â\\x80\\x98What do you desire?â\\x80\\x99 asked the wild man. â\\x80\\x98Take back your horse\\r\\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.â\\x80\\x99 All that he\\r\\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\\r\\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\\r\\nwished him joy of his victory. â\\x80\\x98I am not the one who carried away the\\r\\nvictory,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\\r\\nhis soldiers.â\\x80\\x99 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\\r\\nbut the king did not know, and said: â\\x80\\x98He followed the enemy, and I did\\r\\nnot see him again.â\\x80\\x99 She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\\r\\nhe smiled, and said: â\\x80\\x98He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\\r\\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: â\\x80\\x9cHere comes our\\r\\nhobblety jib back again!â\\x80\\x9d They asked, too: â\\x80\\x9cUnder what hedge have you\\r\\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?â\\x80\\x9d So he said: â\\x80\\x9cI did the best of all,\\r\\nand it would have gone badly without me.â\\x80\\x9d And then he was still more\\r\\nridiculed.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king said to his daughter: â\\x80\\x98I will proclaim a great feast that shall\\r\\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\\r\\nunknown man will show himself.â\\x80\\x99 When the feast was announced, the youth\\r\\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. â\\x80\\x98What do you desire?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nasked he. â\\x80\\x98That I may catch the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughterâ\\x80\\x99s golden apple.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is\\r\\nas safe as if you had it already,â\\x80\\x99 said Iron Hans. â\\x80\\x98You shall likewise\\r\\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\\r\\nchestnut-horse.â\\x80\\x99 When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\\r\\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\\r\\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\\r\\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\\r\\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\\r\\nangry, and said: â\\x80\\x98That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\\r\\nhis name.â\\x80\\x99 He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\\r\\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\\r\\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\\r\\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\\r\\nwith it, the kingâ\\x80\\x99s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\\r\\nhim that he wounded the youthâ\\x80\\x99s leg with the point of his sword. The\\r\\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\\r\\nthat the helmet fell from the youthâ\\x80\\x99s head, and they could see that he\\r\\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter asked the gardener about his\\r\\nboy. â\\x80\\x98He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\\r\\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\\r\\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\\r\\nhis little cap on his head. But the kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter went up to him and\\r\\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\\r\\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. â\\x80\\x98Are you the knight who came\\r\\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\\r\\nthe three golden apples?â\\x80\\x99 asked the king. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98and here\\r\\nthe apples are,â\\x80\\x99 and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\\r\\nto the king. â\\x80\\x98If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\\r\\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\\r\\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If you can perform\\r\\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s boy; tell me, who is your\\r\\nfather?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\\r\\nas I require.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I well see,â\\x80\\x99 said the king, â\\x80\\x98that I owe my thanks to\\r\\nyou; can I do anything to please you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered he, â\\x80\\x98that indeed\\r\\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.â\\x80\\x99 The maiden laughed, and said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\\r\\ngolden hair that he was no gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s boy,â\\x80\\x99 and then she went and\\r\\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\\r\\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\\r\\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\\r\\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\\r\\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: â\\x80\\x98I am\\r\\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\\r\\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT-SKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\\r\\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\\r\\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\\r\\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, â\\x80\\x98Promise me that you\\r\\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\\r\\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.â\\x80\\x99 Then when the king in his\\r\\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\\r\\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\\r\\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, â\\x80\\x98this will not do;\\r\\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.â\\x80\\x99 So messengers were\\r\\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\\r\\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\\r\\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\\r\\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\\r\\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\\r\\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\\r\\nhis courtiers, â\\x80\\x98May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\\r\\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\\r\\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.â\\x80\\x99 When the courtiers heard this\\r\\nthey were shocked, and said, â\\x80\\x98Heaven forbid that a father should marry\\r\\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.â\\x80\\x99 And his daughter\\r\\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\\r\\nso she said to him, â\\x80\\x98Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\\r\\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\\r\\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\\r\\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\\r\\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.â\\x80\\x99 And thus\\r\\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\\r\\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\\r\\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\\r\\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\\r\\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\\r\\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\\r\\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\\r\\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\\r\\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\\r\\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\\r\\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\\r\\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\\r\\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\\r\\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\\r\\non till it was midday.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\\r\\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\\r\\nbark. â\\x80\\x98Look sharp!â\\x80\\x99 said the king to the huntsmen, â\\x80\\x98and see what sort\\r\\nof game lies there.â\\x80\\x99 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\\r\\ncame back again said, â\\x80\\x98In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\\r\\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\\r\\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98See,â\\x80\\x99 said the king, â\\x80\\x98if\\r\\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.â\\x80\\x99 So the huntsmen\\r\\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\\r\\nme and take me with you.â\\x80\\x99 Then they said, â\\x80\\x98Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\\r\\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\\r\\nsort.â\\x80\\x99 So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\\r\\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, â\\x80\\x98Cat-skin, you may lie and\\r\\nsleep there.â\\x80\\x99 And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\\r\\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\\r\\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. â\\x80\\x98Ah! pretty\\r\\nprincess!â\\x80\\x99 thought she, â\\x80\\x98what will now become of thee?â\\x80\\x99 But it happened\\r\\none day that a feast was to be held in the kingâ\\x80\\x99s castle, so she said to\\r\\nthe cook, â\\x80\\x98May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\\r\\ntake care and stand behind the door.â\\x80\\x99 And the cook said, â\\x80\\x98Yes, you may\\r\\ngo, but be back again in half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s time, to rake out the ashes.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\\r\\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\\r\\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\\r\\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\\r\\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\\r\\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. But\\r\\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\\r\\nhe thought in his heart, â\\x80\\x98I never saw any one half so beautiful.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\\r\\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\\r\\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\\r\\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\\r\\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\\r\\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\\r\\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, â\\x80\\x98Let that alone till the morning, and\\r\\nheat the kingâ\\x80\\x99s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\\r\\ntake care you donâ\\x80\\x99t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\\r\\nnever eating again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the kingâ\\x80\\x99s soup, and\\r\\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\\r\\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\\r\\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\\r\\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\\r\\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\\r\\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\\r\\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\\r\\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, â\\x80\\x98You must have let a hair fall\\r\\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.â\\x80\\x99 Then he went\\r\\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. â\\x80\\x98I did,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nanswered the cook. But the king said, â\\x80\\x98That is not true; it was better\\r\\ndone than you could do it.â\\x80\\x99 Then he answered, â\\x80\\x98To tell the truth I did\\r\\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then let Cat-skin come up,â\\x80\\x99 said the\\r\\nking: and when she came he said to her, â\\x80\\x98Who are you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am a poor\\r\\nchild,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98that has lost both father and mother.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How came you\\r\\nin my palace?â\\x80\\x99 asked he. â\\x80\\x98I am good for nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98but to be\\r\\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But how\\r\\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?â\\x80\\x99 asked the king. Then she\\r\\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\\r\\nher away again about her business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\\r\\nher go up and see it as before. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but come again in half\\r\\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.â\\x80\\x99 Then she\\r\\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\\r\\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\\r\\nlooking like a kingâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\\r\\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\\r\\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\\r\\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\\r\\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\\r\\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\\r\\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\\r\\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\\r\\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\\r\\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\\r\\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\\r\\ntime, it happened just the same as before. â\\x80\\x98You must be a witch,\\r\\nCat-skin,â\\x80\\x99 said the cook; â\\x80\\x98for you always put something into your soup,\\r\\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.â\\x80\\x99 However, he let her go up\\r\\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\\r\\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\\r\\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\\r\\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\\r\\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\\r\\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\\r\\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\\r\\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\\r\\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\\r\\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\\r\\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\\r\\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the kingâ\\x80\\x99s soup; and as soon\\r\\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\\r\\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\\r\\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\\r\\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\\r\\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\\r\\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\\r\\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\\r\\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\\r\\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\\r\\nother.â\\x80\\x99 And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\\r\\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\\r\\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\\r\\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\\r\\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\\r\\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\\r\\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\\r\\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\\r\\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\\r\\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\\r\\nthere was nothing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\\r\\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98We will not leave each other,â\\x80\\x99 Rose-red answered: â\\x80\\x98Never so long as we\\r\\nlive,â\\x80\\x99 and their mother would add: â\\x80\\x98What one has she must share with the\\r\\nother.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\\r\\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\\r\\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\\r\\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\\r\\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\\r\\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\\r\\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\\r\\nworry on their account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\\r\\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\\r\\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\\r\\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\\r\\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\\r\\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\\r\\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\\r\\nwatches over good children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their motherâ\\x80\\x99s little cottage so neat that\\r\\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\\r\\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\\r\\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\\r\\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\\r\\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: â\\x80\\x98Go, Snow-white, and\\r\\nbolt the door,â\\x80\\x99 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\\r\\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\\r\\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\\r\\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\\r\\nhidden beneath its wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\\r\\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\\r\\nshelter.â\\x80\\x99 Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\\r\\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\\r\\nhead within the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\\r\\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her motherâ\\x80\\x99s bed. But the bear began\\r\\nto speak and said: â\\x80\\x98Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\\r\\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Poor bear,â\\x80\\x99 said the mother, â\\x80\\x98lie down by the fire, only take care that\\r\\nyou do not burn your coat.â\\x80\\x99 Then she cried: â\\x80\\x98Snow-white, Rose-red, come\\r\\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.â\\x80\\x99 So they both came\\r\\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\\r\\nof him. The bear said: â\\x80\\x98Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\\r\\nlittleâ\\x80\\x99; so they brought the broom and swept the bearâ\\x80\\x99s hide clean;\\r\\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\\r\\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\\r\\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\\r\\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\\r\\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\\r\\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\\r\\nout: â\\x80\\x98Leave me alive, children,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\\r\\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\\r\\nbear: â\\x80\\x98You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\\r\\nthe cold and the bad weather.â\\x80\\x99 As soon as day dawned the two children\\r\\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\\r\\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\\r\\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\\r\\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\\r\\nmorning to Snow-white: â\\x80\\x98Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\\r\\nwhole summer.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Where are you going, then, dear bear?â\\x80\\x99 asked Snow-white.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\\r\\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\\r\\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\\r\\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\\r\\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\\r\\ndoes not easily see daylight again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\\r\\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\\r\\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\\r\\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\\r\\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\\r\\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\\r\\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\\r\\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\\r\\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\\r\\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\\r\\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\\r\\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: â\\x80\\x98Why do you\\r\\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What are you up to,\\r\\nlittle man?â\\x80\\x99 asked Rose-red. â\\x80\\x98You stupid, prying goose!â\\x80\\x99 answered the\\r\\ndwarf: â\\x80\\x98I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\\r\\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\\r\\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\\r\\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\\r\\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\\r\\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\\r\\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\\r\\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\\r\\nwas caught too fast. â\\x80\\x98I will run and fetch someone,â\\x80\\x99 said Rose-red. â\\x80\\x98You\\r\\nsenseless goose!â\\x80\\x99 snarled the dwarf; â\\x80\\x98why should you fetch someone? You\\r\\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t be impatient,â\\x80\\x99 said Snow-white, â\\x80\\x98I will help you,â\\x80\\x99 and she pulled\\r\\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\\r\\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\\r\\nup, grumbling to himself: â\\x80\\x98Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\\r\\nbeard. Bad luck to you!â\\x80\\x99 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\\r\\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\\r\\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\\r\\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\\r\\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. â\\x80\\x98Where are you going?â\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nRose-red; â\\x80\\x98you surely donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go into the water?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am not such\\r\\na fool!â\\x80\\x99 cried the dwarf; â\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that the accursed fish wants\\r\\nto pull me in?â\\x80\\x99 The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\\r\\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\\r\\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\\r\\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\\r\\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\\r\\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\\r\\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\\r\\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\\r\\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\\r\\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\\r\\nhe screamed out: â\\x80\\x98Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\\r\\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\\r\\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!â\\x80\\x99 Then he took\\r\\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\\r\\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\\r\\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\\r\\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\\r\\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\\r\\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\\r\\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\\r\\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\\r\\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\\r\\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\\r\\nwith his shrill voice: â\\x80\\x98Could you not have done it more carefully! You\\r\\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\\r\\nclumsy creatures!â\\x80\\x99 Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\\r\\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\\r\\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\\r\\nbusiness in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\\r\\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\\r\\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\\r\\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\\r\\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\\r\\nat them. â\\x80\\x98Why do you stand gaping there?â\\x80\\x99 cried the dwarf, and his\\r\\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\\r\\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\\r\\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\\r\\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\\r\\nhe cried: â\\x80\\x98Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\\r\\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\\r\\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\\r\\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\\r\\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercyâ\\x80\\x99s sake eat them!â\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\\r\\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: â\\x80\\x98Snow-white and\\r\\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.â\\x80\\x99 Then they\\r\\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\\r\\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\\r\\ngold. â\\x80\\x98I am a kingâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98and I was bewitched by that wicked\\r\\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\\r\\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\\r\\nwell-deserved punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\\r\\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\\r\\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\\r\\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\\r\\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\\r\\nroses, white and red.'"

       "'THE BROTHERS GRIMM FAIRY TALES          THE GOLDEN BIRD      A certain king had a beautiful garden  and in the garden stood a tree  which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted  and about  the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one  of them was gone. The king became very angry at this  and ordered the  gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his  eldest son to watch  but about twelve oâ  clock he fell asleep  and in  the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was  ordered to watch  and at midnight he too fell asleep  and in the morning  another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch  but  the gardener at first would not let him  for fear some harm should come  to him  however  at last he consented  and the young man laid himself  under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling  noise in the air  and a bird came flying that was of pure gold  and as  it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak  the gardenerâ  s son  jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm   only it dropped a golden feather from its tail  and then flew away.  The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning  and all the  council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than  all the wealth of the kingdom  but the king said  â  One feather is of no  use to me  I must have the whole bird.â      Then the gardenerâ  s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden  bird very easily  and when he had gone but a little way  he came to a  wood  and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting  so he took his  bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said  â  Do not shoot me   for I will give you good counsel  I know what your business is  and  that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the  evening  and when you get there  you will see two inns opposite to each  other  one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at  go not in  there  but rest for the night in the other  though it may appear to you  to be very poor and mean.â   But the son thought to himself  â  What can  such a beast as this know about the matter â   So he shot his arrow at  the fox  but he missed it  and it set up its tail above its back and  ran into the wood. Then he went his way  and in the evening came to  the village where the two inns were  and in one of these were people  singing  and dancing  and feasting  but the other looked very dirty   and poor. â  I should be very silly â   said he  â  if I went to that shabby  house  and left this charming placeâ    so he went into the smart house   and ate and drank at his ease  and forgot the bird  and his country too.    Time passed on  and as the eldest son did not come back  and no tidings  were heard of him  the second son set out  and the same thing happened  to him. He met the fox  who gave him the good advice  but when he came  to the two inns  his eldest brother was standing at the window where  the merrymaking was  and called to him to come in  and he could not  withstand the temptation  but went in  and forgot the golden bird and  his country in the same manner.    Time passed on again  and the youngest son too wished to set out into  the wide world to seek for the golden bird  but his father would not  listen to it for a long while  for he was very fond of his son  and  was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also  and prevent his  coming back. However  at last it was agreed he should go  for he would  not rest at home  and as he came to the wood  he met the fox  and heard  the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox  and did not  attempt his life as his brothers had done  so the fox said  â  Sit upon my  tail  and you will travel faster.â   So he sat down  and the fox began to  run  and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair  whistled in the wind.    When they came to the village  the son followed the foxâ  s counsel  and  without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all  night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he  was beginning his journey  and said  â  Go straight forward  till you come  to a castle  before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and  snoring  take no notice of them  but go into the castle and pass on and  on till you come to a room  where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage   close by it stands a beautiful golden cage  but do not try to take the  bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one  otherwise  you will repent it.â   Then the fox stretched out his tail again  and the  young man sat himself down  and away they went over stock and stone till  their hair whistled in the wind.    Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said  so the son went in  and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage  and  below stood the golden cage  and the three golden apples that had been  lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself  â  It will be a  very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cageâ    so  he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.  But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke  and  they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning  the court sat to judge him  and when all was heard  it sentenced him to  die  unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as  swiftly as the wind  and if he did this  he was to have the golden bird  given him for his own.    So he set out once more on his journey  sighing  and in great despair   when on a sudden his friend the fox met him  and said  â  You see now  what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will  still  however  tell you how to find the golden horse  if you will do as  I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the  horse stands in his stall  by his side will lie the groom fast asleep  and snoring  take away the horse quietly  but be sure to put the old  leathern saddle upon him  and not the golden one that is close by it.â    Then the son sat down on the foxâ  s tail  and away they went over stock  and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.    All went right  and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden  saddle. But when the son looked at the horse  he thought it a great pity  to put the leathern saddle upon it. â  I will give him the good one â    said he  â  I am sure he deserves it.â   As he took up the golden saddle the  groom awoke and cried out so loud  that all the guards ran in and took  him prisoner  and in the morning he was again brought before the court  to be judged  and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed  that  if he  could bring thither the beautiful princess  he should live  and have the  bird and the horse given him for his own.    Then he went his way very sorrowful  but the old fox came and said  â  Why  did not you listen to me  If you had  you would have carried away  both the bird and the horse  yet will I once more give you counsel. Go  straight on  and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve  oâ  clock at night the princess goes to the bathing house  go up to her  and give her a kiss  and she will let you lead her away  but take care  you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.â    Then the fox stretched out his tail  and so away they went over stock  and stone till their hair whistled again.    As they came to the castle  all was as the fox had said  and at twelve  oâ  clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the  kiss  and she agreed to run away with him  but begged with many tears  that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused   but she wept still more and more  and fell at his feet  till at last  he consented  but the moment she came to her fatherâ  s house the guards  awoke and he was taken prisoner again.    Then he was brought before the king  and the king said  â  You shall never  have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops  the view from my window.â   Now this hill was so big that the whole world  could not take it away  and when he had worked for seven days  and had  done very little  the fox came and said. â  Lie down and go to sleep  I  will work for you.â   And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone   so he went merrily to the king  and told him that now that it was  removed he must give him the princess.    Then the king was obliged to keep his word  and away went the young man  and the princess  and the fox came and said to him  â  We will have all  three  the princess  the horse  and the bird.â   â  Ah â   said the young man   â  that would be a great thing  but how can you contrive it â      â  If you will only listen â   said the fox  â  it can be done. When you come  to the king  and he asks for the beautiful princess  you must say  â  Here  she is â   Then he will be very joyful  and you will mount the golden  horse that they are to give you  and put out your hand to take leave of  them  but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on  to the horse behind you  clap your spurs to his side  and gallop away as  fast as you can.â      All went right  then the fox said  â  When you come to the castle where  the bird is  I will stay with the princess at the door  and you will  ride in and speak to the king  and when he sees that it is the right  horse  he will bring out the bird  but you must sit still  and say that  you want to look at it  to see whether it is the true golden bird  and  when you get it into your hand  ride away.â      This  too  happened as the fox said  they carried off the bird  the  princess mounted again  and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox  came  and said  â  Pray kill me  and cut off my head and my feet.â   But the  young man refused to do it  so the fox said  â  I will at any rate give  you good counsel  beware of two things  ransom no one from the gallows   and sit down by the side of no river.â   Then away he went. â  Well â    thought the young man  â  it is no hard matter to keep that advice.â      He rode on with the princess  till at last he came to the village where  he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and  uproar  and when he asked what was the matter  the people said  â  Two men  are going to be hanged.â   As he came nearer  he saw that the two men were  his brothers  who had turned robbers  so he said  â  Cannot they in any  way be saved â   But the people said â  No â   unless he would bestow all his  money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to  think about the matter  but paid what was asked  and his brothers were  given up  and went on with him towards their home.    And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them  it was so  cool and pleasant that the two brothers said  â  Let us sit down by the  side of the river  and rest a while  to eat and drink.â   So he said   â  Yes â   and forgot the foxâ  s counsel  and sat down on the side of the  river  and while he suspected nothing  they came behind  and threw him  down the bank  and took the princess  the horse  and the bird  and went  home to the king their master  and said. â  All this have we won by our  labour.â   Then there was great rejoicing made  but the horse would not  eat  the bird would not sing  and the princess wept.    The youngest son fell to the bottom of the riverâ  s bed  luckily it was  nearly dry  but his bones were almost broken  and the bank was so steep  that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more   and scolded him for not following his advice  otherwise no evil would  have befallen him  â  Yet â   said he  â  I cannot leave you here  so lay hold  of my tail and hold fast.â   Then he pulled him out of the river  and said  to him  as he got upon the bank  â  Your brothers have set watch to kill  you  if they find you in the kingdom.â   So he dressed himself as a poor  man  and came secretly to the kingâ  s court  and was scarcely within the  doors when the horse began to eat  and the bird to sing  and the princess  left off weeping. Then he went to the king  and told him all his  brothersâ   roguery  and they were seized and punished  and he had the  princess given to him again  and after the kingâ  s death he was heir to  his kingdom.    A long while after  he went to walk one day in the wood  and the old fox  met him  and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him  and cut  off his head and feet. And at last he did so  and in a moment the  fox was changed into a man  and turned out to be the brother of the  princess  who had been lost a great many many years.          HANS IN LUCK      Some men are born to good luck  all they do or try to do comes  right  all that falls to them is so much gain  all their geese are  swans  all their cards are trumps  toss them which way you will  they  will always  like poor puss  alight upon their legs  and only move on so  much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as  they think of themselves  but what care they for the world  what can it  know about the matter     One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had  worked hard for his master. At last he said  â  Master  my time is up  I  must go home and see my poor mother once more  so pray pay me my wages  and let me go.â   And the master said  â  You have been a faithful and good  servant  Hans  so your pay shall be handsome.â   Then he gave him a lump  of silver as big as his head.    Hans took out his pocket handkerchief  put the piece of silver into it   threw it over his shoulder  and jogged off on his road homewards. As he  went lazily on  dragging one foot after another  a man came in sight   trotting gaily along on a capital horse. â  Ah â   said Hans aloud  â  what a  fine thing it is to ride on horseback  There he sits as easy and happy  as if he was at home  in the chair by his fireside  he trips against no  stones  saves shoe leather  and gets on he hardly knows how.â   Hans did  not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all  and said  â  Well   friend  why do you go on foot then â   â  Ah â   said he  â  I have this load to  carry  to be sure it is silver  but it is so heavy that I canâ  t hold up  my head  and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.â   â  What do you say  of making an exchange â   said the horseman. â  I will give you my horse   and you shall give me the silver  which will save you a great deal of  trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.â   â  With all my  heart â   said Hans  â  but as you are so kind to me  I must tell you one  thing  you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.â    However  the horseman got off  took the silver  helped Hans up  gave him  the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other  and said  â  When  you want to go very fast  smack your lips loudly together  and cry  â  Jip â  â      Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse  drew himself up  squared his  elbows  turned out his toes  cracked his whip  and rode merrily off  one  minute whistling a merry tune  and another singing      â  No care and no sorrow     A fig for the morrow     Weâ  ll laugh and be merry     Sing neigh down derry â      After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster  so he  smacked his lips and cried â  Jip â   Away went the horse full gallop  and  before Hans knew what he was about  he was thrown off  and lay on his  back by the road side. His horse would have ran off  if a shepherd who  was coming by  driving a cow  had not stopped it. Hans soon came to  himself  and got upon his legs again  sadly vexed  and said to the  shepherd  â  This riding is no joke  when a man has the luck to get upon  a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break  his neck. However  Iâ  m off now once for all  I like your cow now a great  deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick  and has  spoiled my best coat  you see  in this puddle  which  by the by  smells  not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at oneâ  s leisure behind that  cow  keep good company  and have milk  butter  and cheese  every day   into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize â   â  Well â   said  the shepherd  â  if you are so fond of her  I will change my cow for your  horse  I like to do good to my neighbours  even though I lose by it  myself.â   â  Done â   said Hans  merrily. â  What a noble heart that good man  has â   thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse  wished Hans  and the cow good morning  and away he rode.    Hans brushed his coat  wiped his face and hands  rested a while  and  then drove off his cow quietly  and thought his bargain a very lucky  one. â  If I have only a piece of bread  and I certainly shall always be  able to get that   I can  whenever I like  eat my butter and cheese with  it  and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk  and what  can I wish for more â   When he came to an inn  he halted  ate up all his  bread  and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had  rested himself he set off again  driving his cow towards his motherâ  s  village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on  till at  last  as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than  an hour to cross  he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue  clave to the roof of his mouth. â  I can find a cure for this â   thought  he  â  now I will milk my cow and quench my thirstâ    so he tied her to the  stump of a tree  and held his leathern cap to milk into  but not a drop  was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow  which was to bring  him milk and butter and cheese  was all that time utterly dry  Hans had  not thought of looking to that.    While he was trying his luck in milking  and managing the matter very  clumsily  the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome  and at  last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down  and there he  lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by  driving a  pig in a wheelbarrow. â  What is the matter with you  my man â   said the  butcher  as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened  how he  was dry  and wanted to milk his cow  but found the cow was dry too. Then  the butcher gave him a flask of ale  saying  â  There  drink and refresh  yourself  your cow will give you no milk  donâ  t you see she is an old  beast  good for nothing but the slaughter house â   â  Alas  alas â   said  Hans  â  who would have thought it  What a shame to take my horse  and  give me only a dry cow  If I kill her  what will she be good for  I hate  cow beef  it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now  like  that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease  one could do  something with it  it would at any rate make sausages.â   â  Well â   said  the butcher  â  I donâ  t like to say no  when one is asked to do a kind   neighbourly thing. To please you I will change  and give you my fine fat  pig for the cow.â   â  Heaven reward you for your kindness and self denial â    said Hans  as he gave the butcher the cow  and taking the pig off the  wheel barrow  drove it away  holding it by the string that was tied to  its leg.    So on he jogged  and all seemed now to go right with him  he had met  with some misfortunes  to be sure  but he was now well repaid for all.  How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at  last got     The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The  countryman stopped to ask what was oâ  clock  this led to further chat   and Hans told him all his luck  how he had so many good bargains  and  how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then  began to tell his tale  and said he was going to take the goose to a  christening. â  Feel â   said he  â  how heavy it is  and yet it is only eight  weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it   it has lived so well â   â  Youâ  re right â   said Hans  as he weighed it in  his hand  â  but if you talk of fat  my pig is no trifle.â   Meantime the  countryman began to look grave  and shook his head. â  Hark ye â   said he   â  my worthy friend  you seem a good sort of fellow  so I canâ  t help doing  you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I  just came from  the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was  dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squireâ  s pig. If  you have  and they catch you  it will be a bad job for you. The least  they will do will be to throw you into the horse pond. Can you swim â      Poor Hans was sadly frightened. â  Good man â   cried he  â  pray get me out  of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born   but he may have been the squireâ  s for aught I can tell  you know this  country better than I do  take my pig and give me the goose.â   â  I ought  to have something into the bargain â   said the countryman  â  give a fat  goose for a pig  indeed  â  Tis not everyone would do so much for you as  that. However  I will not be hard upon you  as you are in trouble.â   Then  he took the string in his hand  and drove off the pig by a side path   while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. â  After all â    thought he  â  that chap is pretty well taken in. I donâ  t care whose pig  it is  but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I  have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast   then the fat will find me in goose grease for six months  and then there  are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow   and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my  mother will be  Talk of a pig  indeed  Give me a fine fat goose.â      As he came to the next village  he saw a scissor grinder with his wheel   working and singing      â  Oâ  er hill and oâ  er dale    So happy I roam     Work light and live well     All the world is my home     Then who so blythe  so merry as I â      Hans stood looking on for a while  and at last said  â  You must be well  off  master grinder  you seem so happy at your work.â   â  Yes â   said the  other  â  mine is a golden trade  a good grinder never puts his hand  into his pocket without finding money in it  but where did you get that  beautiful goose â   â  I did not buy it  I gave a pig for it.â   â  And where  did you get the pig â   â  I gave a cow for it.â   â  And the cow â   â  I gave a  horse for it.â   â  And the horse â   â  I gave a lump of silver as big as my  head for it.â   â  And the silver â   â  Oh  I worked hard for that seven long  years.â   â  You have thriven well in the world hitherto â   said the grinder   â  now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand  in it  your fortune would be made.â   â  Very true  but how is that to be  managed â   â  How  Why  you must turn grinder like myself â   said the other   â  you only want a grindstone  the rest will come of itself. Here is one  that is but little the worse for wear  I would not ask more than the  value of your goose for it  will you buy â   â  How can you ask â   said  Hans  â  I should be the happiest man in the world  if I could have money  whenever I put my hand in my pocket  what could I want more  thereâ  s  the goose.â   â  Now â   said the grinder  as he gave him a common rough stone  that lay by his side  â  this is a most capital stone  do but work it well  enough  and you can make an old nail cut with it.â      Hans took the stone  and went his way with a light heart  his eyes  sparkled for joy  and he said to himself  â  Surely I must have been born  in a lucky hour  everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.  People are so kind  they seem really to think I do them a favour in  letting them make me rich  and giving me good bargains.â      Meantime he began to be tired  and hungry too  for he had given away his  last penny in his joy at getting the cow.    At last he could go no farther  for the stone tired him sadly  and he  dragged himself to the side of a river  that he might take a drink of  water  and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on  the bank  but  as he stooped down to drink  he forgot it  pushed it a  little  and down it rolled  plump into the stream.    For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water  then sprang  up and danced for joy  and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven   with tears in his eyes  for its kindness in taking away his only plague   the ugly heavy stone.    â  How happy am I â   cried he  â  nobody was ever so lucky as I.â   Then up he  got with a light heart  free from all his troubles  and walked on till  he reached his motherâ  s house  and told her how very easy the road to  good luck was.          JORINDA AND JORINDEL      There was once an old castle  that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy  wood  and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take  any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of  an owl  or crept about the country like a cat  but at night she always  became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred  paces of her castle  he became quite fixed  and could not move a step  till she came and set him free  which she would not do till he had given  her his word never to come there again  but when any pretty maiden came  within that space she was changed into a bird  and the fairy put her  into a cage  and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were  seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle  and all with  beautiful birds in them.    Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier  than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before  and a shepherd  lad  whose name was Jorindel  was very fond of her  and they were soon  to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood  that they might be  alone  and Jorindel said  â  We must take care that we donâ  t go too near  to the fairyâ  s castle.â   It was a beautiful evening  the last rays of the  setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon  the green underwood beneath  and the turtle doves sang from the tall  birches.    Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun  Jorindel sat by her side  and  both felt sad  they knew not why  but it seemed as if they were to be  parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way  and when  they looked to see which way they should go home  they found themselves  at a loss to know what path to take.    The sun was setting fast  and already half of its circle had sunk behind  the hill  Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him  and saw through the  bushes that they had  without knowing it  sat down close under the old  walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear  turned pale  and trembled.  Jorinda was just singing      â  The ring dove sang from the willow spray     Well a day  Well a day     He mournâ  d for the fate of his darling mate     Well a day â      when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason  and  beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale  so that her song ended  with a mournful _jug  jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times  round them  and three times screamed      â  Tu whu  Tu whu  Tu whu â      Jorindel could not move  he stood fixed as a stone  and could neither  weep  nor speak  nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down   the gloomy night came  the owl flew into a bush  and a moment after the  old fairy came forth pale and meagre  with staring eyes  and a nose and  chin that almost met one another.    She mumbled something to herself  seized the nightingale  and went away  with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone  but  what could he do  He could not speak  he could not move from the spot  where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse  voice      â  Till the prisoner is fast     And her doom is cast     There stay  Oh  stay     When the charm is around her     And the spell has bound her     Hie away  away â      On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees  before the fairy  and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda  but  she laughed at him  and said he should never see her again  then she  went her way.    He prayed  he wept  he sorrowed  but all in vain. â  Alas â   he said  â  what  will become of me â   He could not go back to his own home  so he went to  a strange village  and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time  did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go   but all in vain  he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.    At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower   and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl  and he dreamt that he  plucked the flower  and went with it in his hand into the castle  and  that everything he touched with it was disenchanted  and that there he  found his Jorinda again.    In the morning when he awoke  he began to search over hill and dale for  this pretty flower  and eight long days he sought for it in vain  but  on the ninth day  early in the morning  he found the beautiful purple  flower  and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop  as big as a costly  pearl. Then he plucked the flower  and set out and travelled day and  night  till he came again to the castle.    He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it  and yet he did not become  fixed as before  but found that he could go quite close up to the door.  Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with  the flower  and it sprang open  so that he went in through the court   and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the  chamber where the fairy sat  with the seven hundred birds singing in  the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry  and  screamed with rage  but she could not come within two yards of him  for  the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at  the birds  but alas  there were many  many nightingales  and how then  should he find out which was his Jorinda  While he was thinking what to  do  he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages  and was making the  best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her  touched  the cage with the flower  and Jorinda stood before him  and threw her  arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever  as beautiful as when  they walked together in the wood.    Then he touched all the other birds with the flower  so that they all  took their old forms again  and he took Jorinda home  where they were  married  and lived happily together many years  and so did a good many  other lads  whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairyâ  s  cages by themselves  much longer than they liked.          THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS      An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him  a great many years  but was now growing old and every day more and more  unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and  began to think of putting an end to him  but the ass  who saw that some  mischief was in the wind  took himself slyly off  and began his journey  towards the great city  â  For there â   thought he  â  I may turn musician.â      After he had travelled a little way  he spied a dog lying by the  roadside and panting as if he were tired. â  What makes you pant so  my  friend â   said the ass. â  Alas â   said the dog  â  my master was going to  knock me on the head  because I am old and weak  and can no longer make  myself useful to him in hunting  so I ran away  but what can I do to  earn my livelihood â   â  Hark ye â   said the ass  â  I am going to the great  city to turn musician  suppose you go with me  and try what you can  do in the same way â   The dog said he was willing  and they jogged on  together.    They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the  road and making a most rueful face. â  Pray  my good lady â   said the ass   â  whatâ  s the matter with you  You look quite out of spirits â   â  Ah  me â    said the cat  â  how can one be in good spirits when oneâ  s life is in  danger  Because I am beginning to grow old  and had rather lie at my  ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice  my mistress  laid hold of me  and was going to drown me  and though I have been lucky  enough to get away from her  I do not know what I am to live upon.â    â  Oh â   said the ass  â  by all means go with us to the great city  you are  a good night singer  and may make your fortune as a musician.â   The cat  was pleased with the thought  and joined the party.    Soon afterwards  as they were passing by a farmyard  they saw a cock  perched upon a gate  and screaming out with all his might and main.  â  Bravo â   said the ass  â  upon my word  you make a famous noise  pray what  is all this about â   â  Why â   said the cock  â  I was just now saying that  we should have fine weather for our washing day  and yet my mistress and  the cook donâ  t thank me for my pains  but threaten to cut off my  head tomorrow  and make broth of me for the guests that are coming  on Sunday â   â  Heaven forbid â   said the ass  â  come with us Master  Chanticleer  it will be better  at any rate  than staying here to have  your head cut off  Besides  who knows  If we care to sing in tune  we  may get up some kind of a concert  so come along with us.â   â  With all my  heart â   said the cock  so they all four went on jollily together.    They could not  however  reach the great city the first day  so when  night came on  they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid  themselves down under a great tree  and the cat climbed up into the  branches  while the cock  thinking that the higher he sat the safer he  should be  flew up to the very top of the tree  and then  according to  his custom  before he went to sleep  looked out on all sides of him to  see that everything was well. In doing this  he saw afar off something  bright and shining and calling to his companions said  â  There must be a  house no great way off  for I see a light.â   â  If that be the case â   said  the ass  â  we had better change our quarters  for our lodging is not the  best in the world â   â  Besides â   added the dog  â  I should not be the  worse for a bone or two  or a bit of meat.â   So they walked off together  towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light  and as they drew  near it became larger and brighter  till they at last came close to a  house in which a gang of robbers lived.    The ass  being the tallest of the company  marched up to the window and  peeped in. â  Well  Donkey â   said Chanticleer  â  what do you see â   â  What  do I see â   replied the ass. â  Why  I see a table spread with all kinds of  good things  and robbers sitting round it making merry.â   â  That would  be a noble lodging for us â   said the cock. â  Yes â   said the ass  â  if we  could only get inâ    so they consulted together how they should contrive  to get the robbers out  and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed  himself upright on his hind legs  with his forefeet resting against the  window  the dog got upon his back  the cat scrambled up to the dogâ  s  shoulders  and the cock flew up and sat upon the catâ  s head. When  all was ready a signal was given  and they began their music. The ass  brayed  the dog barked  the cat mewed  and the cock screamed  and then  they all broke through the window at once  and came tumbling into  the room  amongst the broken glass  with a most hideous clatter  The  robbers  who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert   had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them   and scampered away as fast as they could.    The coast once clear  our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what  the robbers had left  with as much eagerness as if they had not expected  to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves  they  put out the lights  and each once more sought out a resting place to  his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in  the yard  the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door  the  cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes  and the  cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house  and  as they were all  rather tired with their journey  they soon fell asleep.    But about midnight  when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were  out and that all seemed quiet  they began to think that they had been in  too great a hurry to run away  and one of them  who was bolder than  the rest  went to see what was going on. Finding everything still  he  marched into the kitchen  and groped about till he found a match in  order to light a candle  and then  espying the glittering fiery eyes of  the cat  he mistook them for live coals  and held the match to them to  light it. But the cat  not understanding this joke  sprang at his face   and spat  and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully  and away  he ran to the back door  but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the  leg  and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him  and the  cock  who had been awakened by the noise  crowed with all his might. At  this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades  and told  the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house  and had spat at  him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers  how a man with a  knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door  and stabbed him  in the leg  how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a  club  and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out   â  Throw the rascal up here â   After this the robbers never dared to go  back to the house  but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters  that they took up their abode there  and there they are  I dare say  at  this very day.          OLD SULTAN      A shepherd had a faithful dog  called Sultan  who was grown very old   and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife  were standing together before the house the shepherd said  â  I will shoot  old Sultan tomorrow morning  for he is of no use now.â   But his wife  said  â  Pray let the poor faithful creature live  he has served us well a  great many years  and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of  his days.â   â  But what can we do with him â   said the shepherd  â  he has not  a tooth in his head  and the thieves donâ  t care for him at all  to  be sure he has served us  but then he did it to earn his livelihood   tomorrow shall be his last day  depend upon it.â      Poor Sultan  who was lying close by them  heard all that the shepherd  and his wife said to one another  and was very much frightened to think  tomorrow would be his last day  so in the evening he went to his good  friend the wolf  who lived in the wood  and told him all his sorrows   and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. â  Make yourself  easy â   said the wolf  â  I will give you some good advice. Your master   you know  goes out every morning very early with his wife into the  field  and they take their little child with them  and lay it down  behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie  down close by the child  and pretend to be watching it  and I will come  out of the wood and run away with it  you must run after me as fast as  you can  and I will let it drop  then you may carry it back  and they  will think you have saved their child  and will be so thankful to you  that they will take care of you as long as you live.â   The dog liked this  plan very well  and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the  child a little way  the shepherd and his wife screamed out  but Sultan  soon overtook him  and carried the poor little thing back to his master  and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head  and said  â  Old  Sultan has saved our child from the wolf  and therefore he shall live  and be well taken care of  and have plenty to eat. Wife  go home  and  give him a good dinner  and let him have my old cushion to sleep on  as long as he lives.â   So from this time forward Sultan had all that he  could wish for.    Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy  and said  â  Now  my  good fellow  you must tell no tales  but turn your head the other way  when I want to taste one of the old shepherdâ  s fine fat sheep.â   â  No â    said the Sultan  â  I will be true to my master.â   However  the wolf  thought he was in joke  and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But  Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do  so he laid wait  for him behind the barn door  and when the wolf was busy looking out for  a good fat sheep  he had a stout cudgel laid about his back  that combed  his locks for him finely.    Then the wolf was very angry  and called Sultan â  an old rogue â   and  swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the  boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now  Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherdâ  s old  three legged cat  so he took her with him  and as the poor thing limped  along with some trouble  she stuck up her tail straight in the air.    The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground  and when they  espied their enemies coming  and saw the catâ  s long tail standing  straight in the air  they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to  fight with  and every time she limped  they thought she was picking up  a stone to throw at them  so they said they should not like this way of  fighting  and the boar lay down behind a bush  and the wolf jumped  up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up  and looked about and  wondered that no one was there. The boar  however  had not quite hidden  himself  for his ears stuck out of the bush  and when he shook one of  them a little  the cat  seeing something move  and thinking it was a  mouse  sprang upon it  and bit and scratched it  so that the boar jumped  up and grunted  and ran away  roaring out  â  Look up in the tree  there  sits the one who is to blame.â   So they looked up  and espied the wolf  sitting amongst the branches  and they called him a cowardly rascal   and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of  himself  and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.          THE STRAW  THE COAL  AND THE BEAN      In a village dwelt a poor old woman  who had gathered together a dish  of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth  and  that it might burn the quicker  she lighted it with a handful of straw.  When she was emptying the beans into the pan  one dropped without her  observing it  and lay on the ground beside a straw  and soon afterwards  a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw  began and said  â  Dear friends  from whence do you come here â   The coal  replied  â  I fortunately sprang out of the fire  and if I had not escaped  by sheer force  my death would have been certain   I should have been  burnt to ashes.â   The bean said  â  I too have escaped with a whole skin   but if the old woman had got me into the pan  I should have been made  into broth without any mercy  like my comrades.â   â  And would a better  fate have fallen to my lot â   said the straw. â  The old woman has  destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke  she seized sixty of them at  once  and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.â      â  But what are we to do now â   said the coal.    â  I think â   answered the bean  â  that as we have so fortunately escaped  death  we should keep together like good companions  and lest a new  mischance should overtake us here  we should go away together  and  repair to a foreign country.â      The proposition pleased the two others  and they set out on their way  together. Soon  however  they came to a little brook  and as there was  no bridge or foot plank  they did not know how they were to get over  it. The straw hit on a good idea  and said  â  I will lay myself straight  across  and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.â   The straw  therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other  and the coal   who was of an impetuous disposition  tripped quite boldly on to the  newly built bridge. But when she had reached the middle  and heard the  water rushing beneath her  she was after all  afraid  and stood still   and ventured no farther. The straw  however  began to burn  broke in  two pieces  and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her  hissed  when she got into the water  and breathed her last. The bean  who had  prudently stayed behind on the shore  could not but laugh at the event   was unable to stop  and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would  have been all over with her  likewise  if  by good fortune  a tailor who  was travelling in search of work  had not sat down to rest by the brook.  As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread   and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily  but as the  tailor used black thread  all beans since then have a black seam.          BRIAR ROSE      A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off   where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had  plenty of money  and plenty of fine clothes to wear  and plenty of  good things to eat and drink  and a coach to ride out in every day  but  though they had been married many years they had no children  and this  grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking  by the side of the river  at the bottom of the garden  she saw a poor  little fish  that had thrown itself out of the water  and lay gasping  and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little  fish  and threw it back again into the river  and before it swam away  it lifted its head out of the water and said  â  I know what your wish is   and it shall be fulfilled  in return for your kindness to me  you will  soon have a daughter.â   What the little fish had foretold soon came to  pass  and the queen had a little girl  so very beautiful that the king  could not cease looking on it for joy  and said he would hold a great  feast and make merry  and show the child to all the land. So he asked  his kinsmen  and nobles  and friends  and neighbours. But the queen  said  â  I will have the fairies also  that they might be kind and good  to our little daughter.â   Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom   but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat  out of  they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.  So twelve fairies came  each with a high red cap on her head  and red  shoes with high heels on her feet  and a long white wand in her hand   and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all  their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness  another  beauty  another riches  and so on till she had all that was good in the  world.    Just as eleven of them had done blessing her  a great noise was heard in  the courtyard  and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was  come  with a black cap on her head  and black shoes on her feet  and a  broomstick in her hand  and presently up she came into the dining hall.  Now  as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry  and  scolded the king and queen very much  and set to work to take her  revenge. So she cried out  â  The kingâ  s daughter shall  in her fifteenth  year  be wounded by a spindle  and fall down dead.â   Then the twelfth of  the friendly fairies  who had not yet given her gift  came forward  and  said that the evil wish must be fulfilled  but that she could soften its  mischief  so her gift was  that the kingâ  s daughter  when the spindle  wounded her  should not really die  but should only fall asleep for a  hundred years.    However  the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from  the threatened evil  so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom  should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven  fairies were in the meantime fulfilled  for the princess was so  beautiful  and well behaved  and good  and wise  that everyone who knew  her loved her.    It happened that  on the very day she was fifteen years old  the king  and queen were not at home  and she was left alone in the palace. So she  roved about by herself  and looked at all the rooms and chambers  till  at last she came to an old tower  to which there was a narrow staircase  ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key  and when  she turned it the door sprang open  and there sat an old lady spinning  away very busily. â  Why  how now  good mother â   said the princess  â  what  are you doing there â   â  Spinning â   said the old lady  and nodded her  head  humming a tune  while buzz  went the wheel. â  How prettily that  little thing turns round â   said the princess  and took the spindle  and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it  before the  fairyâ  s prophecy was fulfilled  the spindle wounded her  and she fell  down lifeless on the ground.    However  she was not dead  but had only fallen into a deep sleep  and  the king and the queen  who had just come home  and all their court   fell asleep too  and the horses slept in the stables  and the dogs in  the court  the pigeons on the house top  and the very flies slept upon  the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing  and went to  sleep  the jack stopped  and the spit that was turning about with a  goose upon it for the kingâ  s dinner stood still  and the cook  who was  at that moment pulling the kitchen boy by the hair to give him a box  on the ear for something he had done amiss  let him go  and both fell  asleep  the butler  who was slyly tasting the ale  fell asleep with the  jug at his lips  and thus everything stood still  and slept soundly.    A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace  and every year it  became higher and thicker  till at last the old palace was surrounded  and hidden  so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But  there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar  Rose  for so the kingâ  s daughter was called   so that  from time to  time  several kingsâ   sons came  and tried to break through the thicket  into the palace. This  however  none of them could ever do  for the  thorns and bushes laid hold of them  as it were with hands  and there  they stuck fast  and died wretchedly.    After many  many years there came a kingâ  s son into that land  and an  old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns  and how a beautiful  palace stood behind it  and how a wonderful princess  called Briar Rose   lay in it asleep  with all her court. He told  too  how he had heard  from his grandfather that many  many princes had come  and had tried to  break through the thicket  but that they had all stuck fast in it  and  died. Then the young prince said  â  All this shall not frighten me  I  will go and see this Briar Rose.â   The old man tried to hinder him  but  he was bent upon going.    Now that very day the hundred years were ended  and as the prince came  to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs  through  which he went with ease  and they shut in after him as thick as ever.  Then he came at last to the palace  and there in the court lay the dogs  asleep  and the horses were standing in the stables  and on the roof sat  the pigeons fast asleep  with their heads under their wings. And when he  came into the palace  the flies were sleeping on the walls  the spit  was standing still  the butler had the jug of ale at his lips  going  to drink a draught  the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be  plucked  and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand  as  if she was going to beat the boy.    Then he went on still farther  and all was so still that he could hear  every breath he drew  till at last he came to the old tower  and opened  the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was  and there she lay   fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he  could not take his eyes off her  so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.  But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke  and smiled  upon him  and they went out together  and soon the king and queen also  awoke  and all the court  and gazed on each other with great wonder.  And the horses shook themselves  and the dogs jumped up and barked  the  pigeons took their heads from under their wings  and looked about and  flew into the fields  the flies on the walls buzzed again  the fire in  the kitchen blazed up  round went the jack  and round went the spit   with the goose for the kingâ  s dinner upon it  the butler finished his  draught of ale  the maid went on plucking the fowl  and the cook gave  the boy the box on his ear.    And then the prince and Briar Rose were married  and the wedding feast  was given  and they lived happily together all their lives long.          THE DOG AND THE SPARROW      A shepherdâ  s dog had a master who took no care of him  but often let him  suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer  so he  took to his heels  and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.  On the road he met a sparrow that said to him  â  Why are you so sad   my friend â   â  Because â   said the dog  â  I am very very hungry  and have  nothing to eat.â   â  If that be all â   answered the sparrow  â  come with me  into the next town  and I will soon find you plenty of food.â   So on they  went together into the town  and as they passed by a butcherâ  s shop   the sparrow said to the dog  â  Stand there a little while till I peck you  down a piece of meat.â   So the sparrow perched upon the shelf  and having  first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her  she  pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf   till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up  and scrambled  away with it into a corner  where he soon ate it all up. â  Well â   said  the sparrow  â  you shall have some more if you will  so come with me to  the next shop  and I will peck you down another steak.â   When the dog had  eaten this too  the sparrow said to him  â  Well  my good friend  have you  had enough now â   â  I have had plenty of meat â   answered he  â  but I should  like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.â   â  Come with me then â    said the sparrow  â  and you shall soon have that too.â   So she took him  to a bakerâ  s shop  and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window  till  they fell down  and as the dog still wished for more  she took him to  another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten  the  sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. â  Yes â   said he  â  and  now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.â   So they both went  out upon the high road  but as the weather was warm  they had not gone  far before the dog said  â  I am very much tired  I should like to take a  nap.â   â  Very well â   answered the sparrow  â  do so  and in the meantime  I will perch upon that bush.â   So the dog stretched himself out on the  road  and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept  there came by a carter with  a cart drawn by three horses  and loaded with two casks of wine. The  sparrow  seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way  but would  go on in the track in which the dog lay  so as to drive over him  called  out  â  Stop  stop  Mr Carter  or it shall be the worse for you.â   But the  carter  grumbling to himself  â  You make it the worse for me  indeed   what can you do â   cracked his whip  and drove his cart over the poor  dog  so that the wheels crushed him to death. â  There â   cried the  sparrow  â  thou cruel villain  thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now  mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.â    â  Do your worst  and welcome â   said the brute  â  what harm can you do me â    and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart  and  pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it  and then  all the wine ran out  without the carter seeing it. At last he looked  round  and saw that the cart was dripping  and the cask quite empty.  â  What an unlucky wretch I am â   cried he. â  Not wretch enough yet â   said  the sparrow  as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses  and  pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this   he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow  meaning to kill  her  but she flew away  and the blow fell upon the poor horseâ  s head  with such force  that he fell down dead. â  Unlucky wretch that I am â    cried he. â  Not wretch enough yet â   said the sparrow. And as the carter  went on with the other two horses  she again crept under the tilt of the  cart  and pecked out the bung of the second cask  so that all the wine  ran out. When the carter saw this  he again cried out  â  Miserable wretch  that I am â   But the sparrow answered  â  Not wretch enough yet â   and  perched on the head of the second horse  and pecked at him too. The  carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet  but away she  flew  and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the  spot. â  Unlucky wretch that I am â   said he. â  Not wretch enough yet â   said  the sparrow  and perching upon the third horse  she began to peck him  too. The carter was mad with fury  and without looking about him  or  caring what he was about  struck again at the sparrow  but killed his  third horse as he done the other two. â  Alas  miserable wretch that I  am â   cried he. â  Not wretch enough yet â   answered the sparrow as she flew  away  â  now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.â   The  carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him  and to go home  overflowing with rage and vexation. â  Alas â   said he to his wife  â  what  ill luck has befallen me   my wine is all spilt  and my horses all three  dead.â   â  Alas  husband â   replied she  â  and a wicked bird has come into  the house  and has brought with her all the birds in the world  I am  sure  and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft  and are eating it  up at such a rate â   Away ran the husband upstairs  and saw thousands of  birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn  with the sparrow in the  midst of them. â  Unlucky wretch that I am â   cried the carter  for he saw  that the corn was almost all gone. â  Not wretch enough yet â   said the  sparrow  â  thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet â   and away she flew.    The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had  went down  into his kitchen  and was still not sorry for what he had done  but sat  himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat  on the outside of the window  and cried â  Carter  thy cruelty shall cost  thee thy life â   With that he jumped up in a rage  seized his hatchet   and threw it at the sparrow  but it missed her  and only broke the  window. The sparrow now hopped in  perched upon the window seat  and  cried  â  Carter  it shall cost thee thy life â   Then he became mad and  blind with rage  and struck the window seat with such force that he  cleft it in two  and as the sparrow flew from place to place  the carter  and his wife were so furious  that they broke all their furniture   glasses  chairs  benches  the table  and at last the walls  without  touching the bird at all. In the end  however  they caught her  and the  wife said  â  Shall I kill her at once â   â  No â   cried he  â  that is letting  her off too easily  she shall die a much more cruel death  I will eat  her.â   But the sparrow began to flutter about  and stretch out her neck  and cried  â  Carter  it shall cost thee thy life yet â   With that he  could wait no longer  so he gave his wife the hatchet  and cried  â  Wife   strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.â   And the wife struck  but  she missed her aim  and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down  dead  and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.          THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES      There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in  twelve beds all in one room  and when they went to bed  the doors were  shut and locked up  but every morning their shoes were found to be quite  worn through as if they had been danced in all night  and yet nobody  could find out how it happened  or where they had been.    Then the king made it known to all the land  that if any person could  discover the secret  and find out where it was that the princesses  danced in the night  he should have the one he liked best for his  wife  and should be king after his death  but whoever tried and did not  succeed  after three days and nights  should be put to death.    A kingâ  s son soon came. He was well entertained  and in the evening was  taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their  twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance   and  in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it  the door  of his chamber was left open. But the kingâ  s son soon fell asleep  and  when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been  dancing  for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing  happened the second and third night  so the king ordered his head to be  cut off. After him came several others  but they had all the same luck   and all lost their lives in the same manner.    Now it chanced that an old soldier  who had been wounded in battle  and could fight no longer  passed through the country where this king  reigned  and as he was travelling through a wood  he met an old woman   who asked him where he was going. â  I hardly know where I am going  or  what I had better do â   said the soldier  â  but I think I should like very  well to find out where it is that the princesses dance  and then in time  I might be a king.â   â  Well â   said the old dame  â  that is no very hard  task  only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the  princesses will bring to you in the evening  and as soon as she leaves  you pretend to be fast asleep.â      Then she gave him a cloak  and said  â  As soon as you put that on  you will become invisible  and you will then be able to follow the  princesses wherever they go.â   When the soldier heard all this good  counsel  he determined to try his luck  so he went to the king  and said  he was willing to undertake the task.    He was as well received as the others had been  and the king ordered  fine royal robes to be given him  and when the evening came he was led  to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down  the eldest of  the princesses brought him a cup of wine  but the soldier threw it all  away secretly  taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself  down on his bed  and in a little while began to snore very loud as if  he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed  heartily  and the eldest said  â  This fellow too might have done a wiser  thing than lose his life in this way â   Then they rose up and opened  their drawers and boxes  and took out all their fine clothes  and  dressed themselves at the glass  and skipped about as if they were eager  to begin dancing. But the youngest said  â  I donâ  t know how it is  while  you are so happy I feel very uneasy  I am sure some mischance will  befall us.â   â  You simpleton â   said the eldest  â  you are always afraid   have you forgotten how many kingsâ   sons have already watched in vain   And as for this soldier  even if I had not given him his sleeping  draught  he would have slept soundly enough.â      When they were all ready  they went and looked at the soldier  but he  snored on  and did not stir hand or foot  so they thought they were  quite safe  and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands   and the bed sank into the floor and a trap door flew open. The soldier  saw them going down through the trap door one after another  the eldest  leading the way  and thinking he had no time to lose  he jumped up  put  on the cloak which the old woman had given him  and followed them   but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest  princess  and she cried out to her sisters  â  All is not right  someone  took hold of my gown.â   â  You silly creature â   said the eldest  â  it is  nothing but a nail in the wall.â   Then down they all went  and at the  bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees  and  the leaves were all of silver  and glittered and sparkled beautifully.  The soldier wished to take away some token of the place  so he broke  off a little branch  and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the  youngest daughter said again  â  I am sure all is not right  did not you  hear that noise  That never happened before.â   But the eldest said  â  It  is only our princes  who are shouting for joy at our approach.â      Then they came to another grove of trees  where all the leaves were of  gold  and afterwards to a third  where the leaves were all glittering  diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each  and every time there  was a loud noise  which made the youngest sister tremble with fear  but  the eldest still said  it was only the princes  who were crying for joy.  So they went on till they came to a great lake  and at the side of the  lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them   who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.    One of the princesses went into each boat  and the soldier stepped into  the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake  the  prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier  said  â  I do not know why it is  but though I am rowing with all my might  we do not get on so fast as usual  and I am quite tired  the boat  seems very heavy today.â   â  It is only the heat of the weather â   said the  princess  â  I feel it very warm too.â      On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle  from  which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed   and went into the castle  and each prince danced with his princess  and  the soldier  who was all the time invisible  danced with them too  and  when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her  he drank it  all up  so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this   too  the youngest sister was terribly frightened  but the eldest always  silenced her. They danced on till three oâ  clock in the morning  and then  all their shoes were worn out  so that they were obliged to leave off.  The princes rowed them back again over the lake  but this time the  soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess   and on the  opposite shore they took leave of each other  the princesses promising  to come again the next night.    When they came to the stairs  the soldier ran on before the princesses   and laid himself down  and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very  much tired  they heard him snoring in his bed  so they said  â  Now all  is quite safeâ    then they undressed themselves  put away their fine  clothes  pulled off their shoes  and went to bed. In the morning the  soldier said nothing about what had happened  but determined to see more  of this strange adventure  and went again the second and third night   and every thing happened just as before  the princesses danced each time  till their shoes were worn to pieces  and then returned home. However   on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a  token of where he had been.    As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret  he was taken  before the king with the three branches and the golden cup  and the  twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would  say. And when the king asked him. â  Where do my twelve daughters dance at  night â   he answered  â  With twelve princes in a castle under ground.â   And  then he told the king all that had happened  and showed him the three  branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king  called for the princesses  and asked them whether what the soldier said  was true  and when they saw that they were discovered  and that it was  of no use to deny what had happened  they confessed it all. And the king  asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife  and he  answered  â  I am not very young  so I will have the eldest.â    And they  were married that very day  and the soldier was chosen to be the kingâ  s  heir.          THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE      There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty  close  by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a fishing  and  one day  as he sat on the shore with his rod  looking at the sparkling  waves and watching his line  all on a sudden his float was dragged away  deep into the water  and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.  But the fish said  â  Pray let me live  I am not a real fish  I am an  enchanted prince  put me in the water again  and let me go â   â  Oh  ho â    said the man  â  you need not make so many words about the matter  I will  have nothing to do with a fish that can talk  so swim away  sir  as soon  as you please â   Then he put him back into the water  and the fish darted  straight down to the bottom  and left a long streak of blood behind him  on the wave.    When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty  he told her how  he had caught a great fish  and how it had told him it was an enchanted  prince  and how  on hearing it speak  he had let it go again. â  Did not  you ask it for anything â   said the wife  â  we live very wretchedly here   in this nasty dirty pigsty  do go back and tell the fish we want a snug  little cottage.â      The fisherman did not much like the business  however  he went to the  seashore  and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and  green. And he stood at the waterâ  s edge  and said      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      Then the fish came swimming to him  and said  â  Well  what is her will   What does your wife want â   â  Ah â   said the fisherman  â  she says that when  I had caught you  I ought to have asked you for something before I let  you go  she does not like living any longer in the pigsty  and wants  a snug little cottage.â   â  Go home  then â   said the fish  â  she is in the  cottage already â   So the man went home  and saw his wife standing at the  door of a nice trim little cottage. â  Come in  come in â   said she  â  is  not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had â   And there was a  parlour  and a bedchamber  and a kitchen  and behind the cottage there  was a little garden  planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits  and  there was a courtyard behind  full of ducks and chickens. â  Ah â   said the  fisherman  â  how happily we shall live now â   â  We will try to do so  at  least â   said his wife.    Everything went right for a week or two  and then Dame Ilsabill said   â  Husband  there is not near room enough for us in this cottage  the  courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small  I should like to  have a large stone castle to live in  go to the fish again and tell him  to give us a castle.â   â  Wife â   said the fisherman  â  I donâ  t like to go to  him again  for perhaps he will be angry  we ought to be easy with this  pretty cottage to live in.â   â  Nonsense â   said the wife  â  he will do it  very willingly  I know  go along and try â      The fisherman went  but his heart was very heavy  and when he came to  the sea  it looked blue and gloomy  though it was very calm  and he went  close to the edge of the waves  and said      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      â  Well  what does she want now â   said the fish. â  Ah â   said the man   dolefully  â  my wife wants to live in a stone castle.â   â  Go home  then â    said the fish  â  she is standing at the gate of it already.â   So away went  the fisherman  and found his wife standing before the gate of a great  castle. â  See â   said she  â  is not this grand â   With that they went into  the castle together  and found a great many servants there  and the  rooms all richly furnished  and full of golden chairs and tables  and  behind the castle was a garden  and around it was a park half a  mile long  full of sheep  and goats  and hares  and deer  and in the  courtyard were stables and cow houses. â  Well â   said the man  â  now we  will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of  our lives.â   â  Perhaps we may â   said the wife  â  but let us sleep upon it   before we make up our minds to that.â   So they went to bed.    The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight  and  she jogged the fisherman with her elbow  and said  â  Get up  husband   and bestir yourself  for we must be king of all the land.â   â  Wife  wife â    said the man  â  why should we wish to be the king  I will not be king.â    â  Then I will â   said she. â  But  wife â   said the fisherman  â  how can you  be king  the fish cannot make you a king â   â  Husband â   said she  â  say  no more about it  but go and try  I will be king.â   So the man went away  quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time  the sea looked a dark grey colour  and was overspread with curling waves  and the ridges of foam as he cried out      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      â  Well  what would she have now â   said the fish. â  Alas â   said the poor  man  â  my wife wants to be king.â   â  Go home â   said the fish  â  she is king  already.â      Then the fisherman went home  and as he came close to the palace he saw  a troop of soldiers  and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when  he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds   with a golden crown upon her head  and on each side of her stood six  fair maidens  each a head taller than the other. â  Well  wife â   said the  fisherman  â  are you king â   â  Yes â   said she  â  I am king.â   And when he had  looked at her for a long time  he said  â  Ah  wife  what a fine thing it  is to be king  Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long  as we live.â   â  I donâ  t know how that may be â   said she  â  never is a long  time. I am king  it is true  but I begin to be tired of that  and I  think I should like to be emperor.â   â  Alas  wife  why should you wish to  be emperor â   said the fisherman. â  Husband â   said she  â  go to the fish   I say I will be emperor.â   â  Ah  wife â   replied the fisherman  â  the fish  cannot make an emperor  I am sure  and I should not like to ask him for  such a thing.â   â  I am king â   said Ilsabill  â  and you are my slave  so go  at once â      So the fisherman was forced to go  and he muttered as he went along   â  This will come to no good  it is too much to ask  the fish will be  tired at last  and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.â   He  soon came to the seashore  and the water was quite black and muddy  and  a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about  but he  went as near as he could to the waterâ  s brink  and said      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      â  What would she have now â   said the fish. â  Ah â   said the fisherman   â  she wants to be emperor.â   â  Go home â   said the fish  â  she is emperor  already.â      So he went home again  and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill  sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold  with a great crown on  her head full two yards high  and on each side of her stood her guards  and attendants in a row  each one smaller than the other  from the  tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And  before her stood princes  and dukes  and earls  and the fisherman went  up to her and said  â  Wife  are you emperor â   â  Yes â   said she  â  I am  emperor.â   â  Ah â   said the man  as he gazed upon her  â  what a fine thing  it is to be emperor â   â  Husband â   said she  â  why should we stop at being  emperor  I will be pope next.â   â  O wife  wife â   said he  â  how can you be  pope  there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.â   â  Husband â   said  she  â  I will be pope this very day.â   â  But â   replied the husband  â  the  fish cannot make you pope.â   â  What nonsense â   said she  â  if he can make  an emperor  he can make a pope  go and try him.â      So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging  and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves  and the ships were  in trouble  and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the  middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky  but towards  the south all was red  as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight  the fisherman was dreadfully frightened  and he trembled so that his  knees knocked together  but still he went down near to the shore  and  said      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      â  What does she want now â   said the fish. â  Ah â   said the fisherman  â  my  wife wants to be pope.â   â  Go home â   said the fish  â  she is pope already.â      Then the fisherman went home  and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne  that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head  and  around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side  of her were two rows of burning lights  of all sizes  the greatest as  large as the highest and biggest tower in the world  and the least no  larger than a small rushlight. â  Wife â   said the fisherman  as he looked  at all this greatness  â  are you pope â   â  Yes â   said she  â  I am pope.â    â  Well  wife â   replied he  â  it is a grand thing to be pope  and now  you must be easy  for you can be nothing greater.â   â  I will think about  that â   said the wife. Then they went to bed  but Dame Ilsabill could not  sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last  as she  was dropping asleep  morning broke  and the sun rose. â  Ha â   thought she   as she woke up and looked at it through the window  â  after all I cannot  prevent the sun rising.â   At this thought she was very angry  and wakened  her husband  and said  â  Husband  go to the fish and tell him I must  be lord of the sun and moon.â   The fisherman was half asleep  but the  thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.  â  Alas  wife â   said he  â  cannot you be easy with being pope â   â  No â    said she  â  I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my  leave. Go to the fish at once â      Then the man went shivering with fear  and as he was going down to  the shore a dreadful storm arose  so that the trees and the very rocks  shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds  and the  lightnings played  and the thunders rolled  and you might have seen in  the sea great black waves  swelling up like mountains with crowns of  white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea   and cried out  as well as he could      â  O man of the sea     Hearken to me     My wife Ilsabill    Will have her own will     And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee â      â  What does she want now â   said the fish. â  Ah â   said he  â  she wants to  be lord of the sun and moon.â   â  Go home â   said the fish  â  to your pigsty  again.â      And there they live to this very day.          THE WILLOW WREN AND THE BEAR      Once in summer time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest   and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said  â  Brother  wolf  what bird is it that sings so well â   â  That is the King of birds â    said the wolf  â  before whom we must bow down.â   In reality the bird was  the willow wren. â  IF thatâ  s the case â   said the bear  â  I should very  much like to see his royal palace  come  take me thither.â   â  That is not  done quite as you seem to think â   said the wolf  â  you must wait until  the Queen comes â   Soon afterwards  the Queen arrived with some food in  her beak  and the lord King came too  and they began to feed their young  ones. The bear would have liked to go at once  but the wolf held him  back by the sleeve  and said  â  No  you must wait until the lord and lady  Queen have gone away again.â   So they took stock of the hole where the  nest lay  and trotted away. The bear  however  could not rest until he  had seen the royal palace  and when a short time had passed  went to it  again. The King and Queen had just flown out  so he peeped in and saw  five or six young ones lying there. â  Is that the royal palace â   cried  the bear  â  it is a wretched palace  and you are not Kingâ  s children  you  are disreputable children â   When the young wrens heard that  they were  frightfully angry  and screamed  â  No  that we are not  Our parents are  honest people  Bear  you will have to pay for that â      The bear and the wolf grew uneasy  and turned back and went into their  holes. The young willow wrens  however  continued to cry and scream  and  when their parents again brought food they said  â  We will not so much as  touch one flyâ  s leg  no  not if we were dying of hunger  until you have  settled whether we are respectable children or not  the bear has been  here and has insulted us â   Then the old King said  â  Be easy  he shall  be punished â   and he at once flew with the Queen to the bearâ  s cave  and  called in  â  Old Growler  why have you insulted my children  You shall  suffer for it  we will punish you by a bloody war.â   Thus war was  announced to the Bear  and all four footed animals were summoned to take  part in it  oxen  asses  cows  deer  and every other animal the earth  contained. And the willow wren summoned everything which flew in the  air  not only birds  large and small  but midges  and hornets  bees and  flies had to come.    When the time came for the war to begin  the willow wren sent out spies  to discover who was the enemyâ  s commander in chief. The gnat  who was  the most crafty  flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled   and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be  announced. There stood the bear  and he called the fox before him  and said  â  Fox  you are the most cunning of all animals  you shall be  general and lead us.â   â  Good â   said the fox  â  but what signal shall we  agree upon â   No one knew that  so the fox said  â  I have a fine long  bushy tail  which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift  my tail up quite high  all is going well  and you must charge  but if I  let it hang down  run away as fast as you can.â   When the gnat had heard  that  she flew away again  and revealed everything  down to the minutest  detail  to the willow wren. When day broke  and the battle was to begin   all the four footed animals came running up with such a noise that the  earth trembled. The willow wren with his army also came flying through  the air with such a humming  and whirring  and swarming that every one  was uneasy and afraid  and on both sides they advanced against each  other. But the willow wren sent down the hornet  with orders to settle  beneath the foxâ  s tail  and sting with all his might. When the fox felt  the first string  he started so that he lifted one leg  from pain  but  he bore it  and still kept his tail high in the air  at the second  sting  he was forced to put it down for a moment  at the third  he could  hold out no longer  screamed  and put his tail between his legs. When  the animals saw that  they thought all was lost  and began to flee  each  into his hole  and the birds had won the battle.    Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried   â  Children  rejoice  eat and drink to your heartâ  s content  we have won  the battle â   But the young wrens said  â  We will not eat yet  the bear  must come to the nest  and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable  children  before we will do that.â   Then the willow wren flew to the  bearâ  s hole and cried  â  Growler  you are to come to the nest to my  children  and beg their pardon  or else every rib of your body shall  be broken.â   So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear  and begged  their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied  and sat  down together and ate and drank  and made merry till quite late into the  night.          THE FROG PRINCE      One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs  and went  out to take a walk by herself in a wood  and when she came to a cool  spring of water  that rose in the midst of it  she sat herself down  to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand  which was her  favourite plaything  and she was always tossing it up into the air  and  catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that  she missed catching it as it fell  and the ball bounded away  and rolled  along upon the ground  till at last it fell down into the spring. The  princess looked into the spring after her ball  but it was very deep  so  deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail  her loss  and said  â  Alas  if I could only get my ball again  I would  give all my fine clothes and jewels  and everything that I have in the  world.â      Whilst she was speaking  a frog put its head out of the water  and said   â  Princess  why do you weep so bitterly â   â  Alas â   said she  â  what can you  do for me  you nasty frog  My golden ball has fallen into the spring.â    The frog said  â  I want not your pearls  and jewels  and fine clothes   but if you will love me  and let me live with you and eat from off  your golden plate  and sleep upon your bed  I will bring you your ball  again.â   â  What nonsense â   thought the princess  â  this silly frog is  talking  He can never even get out of the spring to visit me  though  he may be able to get my ball for me  and therefore I will tell him he  shall have what he asks.â   So she said to the frog  â  Well  if you will  bring me my ball  I will do all you ask.â   Then the frog put his head  down  and dived deep under the water  and after a little while he came  up again  with the ball in his mouth  and threw it on the edge of the  spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball  she ran to pick  it up  and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again  that she  never thought of the frog  but ran home with it as fast as she could.  The frog called after her  â  Stay  princess  and take me with you as you  said â   But she did not stop to hear a word.    The next day  just as the princess had sat down to dinner  she heard a  strange noise  tap  tap  plash  plash  as if something was coming up the  marble staircase  and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the  door  and a little voice cried out and said      â  Open the door  my princess dear     Open the door to thy true love here     And mind the words that thou and I said    By the fountain cool  in the greenwood shade.â      Then the princess ran to the door and opened it  and there she saw  the frog  whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly  frightened  and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her  seat. The king  her father  seeing that something had frightened her   asked her what was the matter. â  There is a nasty frog â   said she  â  at  the door  that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning  I  told him that he should live with me here  thinking that he could never  get out of the spring  but there he is at the door  and he wants to come  in.â      While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door  and said      â  Open the door  my princess dear     Open the door to thy true love here     And mind the words that thou and I said    By the fountain cool  in the greenwood shade.â      Then the king said to the young princess  â  As you have given your word  you must keep it  so go and let him in.â   She did so  and the frog hopped  into the room  and then straight on  tap  tap  plash  plash  from the  bottom of the room to the top  till he came up close to the table where  the princess sat. â  Pray lift me upon chair â   said he to the princess   â  and let me sit next to you.â   As soon as she had done this  the frog  said  â  Put your plate nearer to me  that I may eat out of it.â   This  she did  and when he had eaten as much as he could  he said  â  Now I am  tired  carry me upstairs  and put me into your bed.â   And the princess   though very unwilling  took him up in her hand  and put him upon the  pillow of her own bed  where he slept all night long. As soon as it was  light he jumped up  hopped downstairs  and went out of the house.  â  Now  then â   thought the princess  â  at last he is gone  and I shall be  troubled with him no more.â      But she was mistaken  for when night came again she heard the same  tapping at the door  and the frog came once more  and said      â  Open the door  my princess dear     Open the door to thy true love here     And mind the words that thou and I said    By the fountain cool  in the greenwood shade.â      And when the princess opened the door the frog came in  and slept upon  her pillow as before  till the morning broke. And the third night he did  the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was  astonished to see  instead of the frog  a handsome prince  gazing on her  with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen  and standing at the head  of her bed.    He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy  who had  changed him into a frog  and that he had been fated so to abide till  some princess should take him out of the spring  and let him eat from  her plate  and sleep upon her bed for three nights. â  You â   said the  prince  â  have broken his cruel charm  and now I have nothing to wish for  but that you should go with me into my fatherâ  s kingdom  where I will  marry you  and love you as long as you live.â      The young princess  you may be sure  was not long in saying â  Yesâ   to  all this  and as they spoke a gay coach drove up  with eight beautiful  horses  decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness  and behind  the coach rode the princeâ  s servant  faithful Heinrich  who had bewailed  the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so  bitterly  that his heart had well nigh burst.    They then took leave of the king  and got into the coach with eight  horses  and all set out  full of joy and merriment  for the princeâ  s  kingdom  which they reached safely  and there they lived happily a great  many years.          CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP      A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse  and had said so much  to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her  that at  length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.  â  But we must make a provision for winter  or else we shall suffer  from hunger â   said the cat  â  and you  little mouse  cannot venture  everywhere  or you will be caught in a trap some day.â   The good advice  was followed  and a pot of fat was bought  but they did not know where  to put it. At length  after much consideration  the cat said  â  I know no  place where it will be better stored up than in the church  for no one  dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar   and not touch it until we are really in need of it.â   So the pot was  placed in safety  but it was not long before the cat had a great  yearning for it  and said to the mouse  â  I want to tell you something   little mouse  my cousin has brought a little son into the world  and has  asked me to be godmother  he is white with brown spots  and I am to hold  him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today  and you look  after the house by yourself.â   â  Yes  yes â   answered the mouse  â  by all  means go  and if you get anything very good to eat  think of me. I  should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.â   All this   however  was untrue  the cat had no cousin  and had not been asked to  be godmother. She went straight to the church  stole to the pot of fat   began to lick at it  and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a  walk upon the roofs of the town  looked out for opportunities  and then  stretched herself in the sun  and licked her lips whenever she thought  of the pot of fat  and not until it was evening did she return home.  â  Well  here you are again â   said the mouse  â  no doubt you have had a  merry day.â   â  All went off well â   answered the cat. â  What name did they  give the child â   â  Top off â   said the cat quite coolly. â  Top off â   cried  the mouse  â  that is a very odd and uncommon name  is it a usual one in  your family â   â  What does that matter â   said the cat  â  it is no worse  than Crumb stealer  as your godchildren are called.â      Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to  the mouse  â  You must do me a favour  and once more manage the house for  a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother  and  as the child has a  white ring round its neck  I cannot refuse.â   The good mouse consented   but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church  and devoured  half the pot of fat. â  Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to  oneself â   said she  and was quite satisfied with her dayâ  s work. When  she went home the mouse inquired  â  And what was the child christened â    â  Half done â   answered the cat. â  Half done  What are you saying  I  never heard the name in my life  Iâ  ll wager anything it is not in the  calendar â      The catâ  s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. â  All good  things go in threes â   said she  â  I am asked to stand godmother again.  The child is quite black  only it has white paws  but with that  exception  it has not a single white hair on its whole body  this only  happens once every few years  you will let me go  wonâ  t you â   â  Top off   Half done â   answered the mouse  â  they are such odd names  they make me  very thoughtful.â   â  You sit at home â   said the cat  â  in your dark grey  fur coat and long tail  and are filled with fancies  thatâ  s because  you do not go out in the daytime.â   During the catâ  s absence the mouse  cleaned the house  and put it in order  but the greedy cat entirely  emptied the pot of fat. â  When everything is eaten up one has some  peace â   said she to herself  and well filled and fat she did not return  home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to  the third child. â  It will not please you more than the others â   said the  cat. â  He is called All gone.â   â  All gone â   cried the mouse â  that is the  most suspicious name of all  I have never seen it in print. All gone   what can that mean â   and she shook her head  curled herself up  and lay  down to sleep.    From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother  but  when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found  outside  the mouse thought of their provision  and said  â  Come  cat   we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves  we  shall enjoy that.â   â  Yes â   answered the cat  â  you will enjoy it as much  as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the  window.â   They set out on their way  but when they arrived  the pot of  fat certainly was still in its place  but it was empty. â  Alas â   said the  mouse  â  now I see what has happened  now it comes to light  You are a true  friend  You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First  top off  then half done  then  â   â  Will you hold your tongue â   cried the  cat  â  one word more  and I will eat you too.â   â  All goneâ   was already on  the poor mouseâ  s lips  scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang  on her  seized her  and swallowed her down. Verily  that is the way of  the world.          THE GOOSE GIRL      The king of a great land died  and left his queen to take care of their  only child. This child was a daughter  who was very beautiful  and her  mother loved her dearly  and was very kind to her. And there was a good  fairy too  who was fond of the princess  and helped her mother to watch  over her. When she grew up  she was betrothed to a prince who lived a  great way off  and as the time drew near for her to be married  she  got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her  mother  packed up a great many costly things  jewels  and gold  and  silver  trinkets  fine dresses  and in short everything that became a  royal bride. And she gave her a waiting maid to ride with her  and give  her into the bridegroomâ  s hands  and each had a horse for the journey.  Now the princessâ  s horse was the fairyâ  s gift  and it was called Falada   and could speak.    When the time came for them to set out  the fairy went into her  bed chamber  and took a little knife  and cut off a lock of her hair   and gave it to the princess  and said  â  Take care of it  dear child  for  it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.â   Then they all took  a sorrowful leave of the princess  and she put the lock of hair into  her bosom  got upon her horse  and set off on her journey to her  bridegroomâ  s kingdom.    One day  as they were riding along by a brook  the princess began to  feel very thirsty  and she said to her maid  â  Pray get down  and fetch  me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook  for I want to  drink.â   â  Nay â   said the maid  â  if you are thirsty  get off yourself  and  stoop down by the water and drink  I shall not be your waiting maid any  longer.â   Then she was so thirsty that she got down  and knelt over the  little brook  and drank  for she was frightened  and dared not bring out  her golden cup  and she wept and said  â  Alas  what will become of me â    And the lock answered her  and said      â  Alas  alas  if thy mother knew it     Sadly  sadly  would she rue it.â      But the princess was very gentle and meek  so she said nothing to her  maidâ  s ill behaviour  but got upon her horse again.    Then all rode farther on their journey  till the day grew so warm  and  the sun so scorching  that the bride began to feel very thirsty again   and at last  when they came to a river  she forgot her maidâ  s rude  speech  and said  â  Pray get down  and fetch me some water to drink in  my golden cup.â   But the maid answered her  and even spoke more haughtily  than before  â  Drink if you will  but I shall not be your waiting maid.â    Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse  and lay  down  and held her head over the running stream  and cried and said   â  What will become of me â   And the lock of hair answered her again      â  Alas  alas  if thy mother knew it     Sadly  sadly  would she rue it.â      And as she leaned down to drink  the lock of hair fell from her bosom   and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did  not see it  but her maid saw it  and was very glad  for she knew the  charm  and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power  now that  she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking  and would  have got upon Falada again  the maid said  â  I shall ride upon Falada   and you may have my horse insteadâ    so she was forced to give up her  horse  and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her  maidâ  s shabby ones.    At last  as they drew near the end of their journey  this treacherous  servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had  happened. But Falada saw it all  and marked it well.    Then the waiting maid got upon Falada  and the real bride rode upon the  other horse  and they went on in this way till at last they came to the  royal court. There was great joy at their coming  and the prince flew to  meet them  and lifted the maid from her horse  thinking she was the one  who was to be his wife  and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber   but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.    Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do  so he  amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window  looking at what was  going on  and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty   and too delicate for a waiting maid  he went up into the royal chamber  to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her  that was thus left  standing in the court below. â  I brought her with me for the sake of her  company on the road â   said she  â  pray give the girl some work to do   that she may not be idle.â   The old king could not for some time think  of any work for her to do  but at last he said  â  I have a lad who takes  care of my geese  she may go and help him.â   Now the name of this lad   that the real bride was to help in watching the kingâ  s geese  was  Curdken.    But the false bride said to the prince  â  Dear husband  pray do me one  piece of kindness.â   â  That I will â   said the prince. â  Then tell one of  your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon  for it  was very unruly  and plagued me sadly on the roadâ    but the truth was   she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak  and  tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point  and the  faithful Falada was killed  but when the true princess heard of it  she  wept  and begged the man to nail up Faladaâ  s head against a large  dark gate of the city  through which she had to pass every morning  and evening  that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the  slaughterer said he would do as she wished  and cut off the head  and  nailed it up under the dark gate.    Early the next morning  as she and Curdken went out through the gate   she said sorrowfully      â  Falada  Falada  there thou hangest â      and the head answered      â  Bride  bride  there thou gangest     Alas  alas  if thy mother knew it     Sadly  sadly  would she rue it.â      Then they went out of the city  and drove the geese on. And when she  came to the meadow  she sat down upon a bank there  and let down her  waving locks of hair  which were all of pure silver  and when Curdken  saw it glitter in the sun  he ran up  and would have pulled some of the  locks out  but she cried      â  Blow  breezes  blow     Let Curdkenâ  s hat go     Blow  breezes  blow     Let him after it go     Oâ  er hills  dales  and rocks     Away be it whirlâ  d    Till the silvery locks    Are all combâ  d and curlâ  d     Then there came a wind  so strong that it blew off Curdkenâ  s hat  and  away it flew over the hills  and he was forced to turn and run after  it  till  by the time he came back  she had done combing and curling her  hair  and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky   and would not speak to her at all  but they watched the geese until it  grew dark in the evening  and then drove them homewards.    The next morning  as they were going through the dark gate  the poor  girl looked up at Faladaâ  s head  and cried      â  Falada  Falada  there thou hangest â      and the head answered      â  Bride  bride  there thou gangest     Alas  alas  if thy mother knew it     Sadly  sadly  would she rue it.â      Then she drove on the geese  and sat down again in the meadow  and began  to comb out her hair as before  and Curdken ran up to her  and wanted to  take hold of it  but she cried out quickly      â  Blow  breezes  blow     Let Curdkenâ  s hat go     Blow  breezes  blow     Let him after it go     Oâ  er hills  dales  and rocks     Away be it whirlâ  d    Till the silvery locks    Are all combâ  d and curlâ  d     Then the wind came and blew away his hat  and off it flew a great way   over the hills and far away  so that he had to run after it  and when  he came back she had bound up her hair again  and all was safe. So they  watched the geese till it grew dark.    In the evening  after they came home  Curdken went to the old king  and  said  â  I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any  longer.â   â  Why â   said the king. â  Because  instead of doing any good  she  does nothing but tease me all day long.â   Then the king made him tell him  what had happened. And Curdken said  â  When we go in the morning through  the dark gate with our flock of geese  she cries and talks with the head  of a horse that hangs upon the wall  and says      â  Falada  Falada  there thou hangest â      and the head answers      â  Bride  bride  there thou gangest     Alas  alas  if thy mother knew it     Sadly  sadly  would she rue it.â      And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow  where the geese fed  how his hat was blown away  and how he was forced  to run after it  and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the  old king told the boy to go out again the next day  and when morning  came  he placed himself behind the dark gate  and heard how she spoke  to Falada  and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field  and  hid himself in a bush by the meadowâ  s side  and he soon saw with his own  eyes how they drove the flock of geese  and how  after a little time   she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her  say      â  Blow  breezes  blow     Let Curdkenâ  s hat go     Blow  breezes  blow     Let him after it go     Oâ  er hills  dales  and rocks     Away be it whirlâ  d    Till the silvery locks    Are all combâ  d and curlâ  d     And soon came a gale of wind  and carried away Curdkenâ  s hat  and away  went Curdken after it  while the girl went on combing and curling her  hair. All this the old king saw  so he went home without being seen  and  when the little goose girl came back in the evening he called her aside   and asked her why she did so  but she burst into tears  and said  â  That  I must not tell you or any man  or I shall lose my life.â      But the old king begged so hard  that she had no peace till she had told  him all the tale  from beginning to end  word for word. And it was very  lucky for her that she did so  for when she had done the king ordered  royal clothes to be put upon her  and gazed on her with wonder  she was  so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a  false bride  for that she was merely a waiting maid  while the true  bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty  and  heard how meek and patient she had been  and without saying anything to  the false bride  the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all  his court. The bridegroom sat at the top  with the false princess on one  side  and the true one on the other  but nobody knew her again  for her  beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes  and she did not seem at all  like the little goose girl  now that she had her brilliant dress on.    When they had eaten and drank  and were very merry  the old king said  he would tell them a tale. So he began  and told all the story of the  princess  as if it was one that he had once heard  and he asked the  true waiting maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would  behave thus. â  Nothing better â   said this false bride  â  than that she  should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails  and that  two white horses should be put to it  and should drag it from street to  street till she was dead.â   â  Thou art she â   said the old king  â  and as  thou has judged thyself  so shall it be done to thee.â   And the young  king was then married to his true wife  and they reigned over the  kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives  and the good fairy came  to see them  and restored the faithful Falada to life again.          THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET      1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS    â  The nuts are quite ripe now â   said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet   â  suppose we go together to the mountains  and eat as many as we can   before the squirrel takes them all away.â   â  With all my heart â   said  Partlet  â  let us go and make a holiday of it together.â      So they went to the mountains  and as it was a lovely day  they stayed  there till the evening. Now  whether it was that they had eaten so many  nuts that they could not walk  or whether they were lazy and would not   I do not know  however  they took it into their heads that it did not  become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little  carriage of nutshells  and when it was finished  Partlet jumped into  it and sat down  and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her  home. â  Thatâ  s a good joke â   said Chanticleer  â  no  that will never do   I had rather by half walk home  Iâ  ll sit on the box and be coachman   if you like  but Iâ  ll not draw.â   While this was passing  a duck came  quacking up and cried out  â  You thieving vagabonds  what business have  you in my grounds  Iâ  ll give it you well for your insolence â   and upon  that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no  coward  and returned the duckâ  s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely  that she soon began to cry out for mercy  which was only granted her  upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she  agreed to do  and Chanticleer got upon the box  and drove  crying  â  Now   duck  get on as fast as you can.â   And away they went at a pretty good  pace.    After they had travelled along a little way  they met a needle and a pin  walking together along the road  and the needle cried out  â  Stop  stop â    and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way  and such  dirty walking they could not get on at all  he told them that he and his  friend  the pin  had been at a public house a few miles off  and had sat  drinking till they had forgotten how late it was  he begged therefore  that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their  carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows  and not  likely to take up much room  told them they might ride  but made them  promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in  nor to  tread on Partletâ  s toes.    Late at night they arrived at an inn  and as it was bad travelling in  the dark  and the duck seemed much tired  and waddled about a good  deal from one side to the other  they made up their minds to fix their  quarters there  but the landlord at first was unwilling  and said his  house was full  thinking they might not be very respectable company   however  they spoke civilly to him  and gave him the egg which Partlet  had laid by the way  and said they would give him the duck  who was in  the habit of laying one every day  so at last he let them come in  and  they bespoke a handsome supper  and spent the evening very jollily.    Early in the morning  before it was quite light  and when nobody was  stirring in the inn  Chanticleer awakened his wife  and  fetching the  egg  they pecked a hole in it  ate it up  and threw the shells into the  fireplace  they then went to the pin and needle  who were fast asleep   and seizing them by the heads  stuck one into the landlordâ  s easy chair  and the other into his handkerchief  and  having done this  they crept  away as softly as possible. However  the duck  who slept in the open  air in the yard  heard them coming  and jumping into the brook which ran  close by the inn  soon swam out of their reach.    An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up  and took his handkerchief  to wipe his face  but the pin ran into him and pricked him  then he  walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire  but when he  stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes  and almost blinded him.  â  Bless me â   said he  â  all the world seems to have a design against my  head this morningâ    and so saying  he threw himself sulkily into his  easy chair  but  oh dear  the needle ran into him  and this time the  pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion  and   suspecting the company who had come in the night before  he went to look  after them  but they were all off  so he swore that he never again  would take in such a troop of vagabonds  who ate a great deal  paid no  reckoning  and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.      2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES    Another day  Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together   so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels  and  harnessed six mice to it  and then he and Partlet got into the carriage   and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them  and said  â  Where  are you going â   And Chanticleer replied      â  All on our way    A visit to pay    To Mr Korbes  the fox  today.â      Then the cat said  â  Take me with you â   Chanticleer said  â  With all my  heart  get up behind  and be sure you do not fall off.â       â  Take care of this handsome coach of mine     Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine     Now  mice  be ready     And  wheels  run steady     For we are going a visit to pay    To Mr Korbes  the fox  today.â      Soon after came up a millstone  an egg  a duck  and a pin  and  Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with  them.    When they arrived at Mr Korbesâ  s house  he was not at home  so the mice  drew the carriage into the coach house  Chanticleer and Partlet flew  upon a beam  the cat sat down in the fireplace  the duck got into  the washing cistern  the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow  the  millstone laid himself over the house door  and the egg rolled himself  up in the towel.    When Mr Korbes came home  he went to the fireplace to make a fire  but  the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes  so he ran to the kitchen to  wash himself  but there the duck splashed all the water in his face  and  when he tried to wipe himself  the egg broke to pieces in the towel all  over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry  and went without his  supper to bed  but when he laid his head on the pillow  the pin ran into  his cheek  at this he became quite furious  and  jumping up  would have  run out of the house  but when he came to the door  the millstone fell  down on his head  and killed him on the spot.      3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED  AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF    Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains  to eat nuts  and it was settled that all the nuts which they found  should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large  nut  but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer  and kept it all to  herself  however  it was so big that she could not swallow it  and it  stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright  and cried out to  Chanticleer  â  Pray run as fast as you can  and fetch me some water  or I  shall be choked.â   Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river  and  said  â  River  give me some water  for Partlet lies in the mountain  and  will be choked by a great nut.â   The river said  â  Run first to the bride   and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.â   Chanticleer ran to  the bride  and said  â  Bride  you must give me a silken cord  for then  the river will give me water  and the water I will carry to Partlet  who  lies on the mountain  and will be choked by a great nut.â   But the bride  said  â  Run first  and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow  in the garden.â   Then Chanticleer ran to the garden  and took the garland  from the bough where it hung  and brought it to the bride  and then  the bride gave him the silken cord  and he took the silken cord to  the river  and the river gave him water  and he carried the water to  Partlet  but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut  and lay  quite dead  and never moved any more.    Then Chanticleer was very sorry  and cried bitterly  and all the beasts  came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little  hearse to carry her to her grave  and when it was ready they harnessed  themselves before it  and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they  met the fox. â  Where are you going  Chanticleer â   said he. â  To bury my  Partlet â   said the other. â  May I go with you â   said the fox. â  Yes  but  you must get up behind  or my horses will not be able to draw you.â   Then  the fox got up behind  and presently the wolf  the bear  the goat  and  all the beasts of the wood  came and climbed upon the hearse.    So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. â  How shall we get  over â   said Chanticleer. Then said a straw  â  I will lay myself across   and you may pass over upon me.â   But as the mice were going over  the  straw slipped away and fell into the water  and the six mice all fell in  and were drowned. What was to be done  Then a large log of wood came  and said  â  I am big enough  I will lay myself across the stream  and you  shall pass over upon me.â   So he laid himself down  but they managed  so clumsily  that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the  stream. Then a stone  who saw what had happened  came up and kindly  offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream   and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse  and  managed to get Partlet out of it  but the fox and the other mourners   who were sitting behind  were too heavy  and fell back into the water  and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.    Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet  and having dug  a grave for her  he laid her in it  and made a little hillock over her.  Then he sat down by the grave  and wept and mourned  till at last he  died too  and so all were dead.          RAPUNZEL      There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a  child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.  These people had a little window at the back of their house from which  a splendid garden could be seen  which was full of the most beautiful  flowers and herbs. It was  however  surrounded by a high wall  and no  one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress  who had  great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was  standing by this window and looking down into the garden  when she saw a  bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion  rapunzel   and it  looked so fresh and green that she longed for it  she quite pined away   and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed  and  asked  â  What ails you  dear wife â   â  Ah â   she replied  â  if I canâ  t eat  some of the rampion  which is in the garden behind our house  I shall  die.â   The man  who loved her  thought  â  Sooner than let your wife die   bring her some of the rampion yourself  let it cost what it will.â    At twilight  he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the  enchantress  hastily clutched a handful of rampion  and took it to his  wife. She at once made herself a salad of it  and ate it greedily. It  tasted so good to her  so very good  that the next day she longed for it  three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest  her husband  must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening  therefore  he let himself down again  but when he had clambered down the  wall he was terribly afraid  for he saw the enchantress standing before  him. â  How can you dare â   said she with angry look  â  descend into my  garden and steal my rampion like a thief  You shall suffer for it â    â  Ah â   answered he  â  let mercy take the place of justice  I only made  up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the  window  and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she  had not got some to eat.â   Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be  softened  and said to him  â  If the case be as you say  I will allow  you to take away with you as much rampion as you will  only I make one  condition  you must give me the child which your wife will bring into  the world  it shall be well treated  and I will care for it like a  mother.â   The man in his terror consented to everything  and when the  woman was brought to bed  the enchantress appeared at once  gave the  child the name of Rapunzel  and took it away with her.    Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was  twelve years old  the enchantress shut her into a tower  which lay in  a forest  and had neither stairs nor door  but quite at the top was a  little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in  she placed herself  beneath it and cried      â  Rapunzel  Rapunzel     Let down your hair to me.â      Rapunzel had magnificent long hair  fine as spun gold  and when she  heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses   wound them round one of the hooks of the window above  and then the hair  fell twenty ells down  and the enchantress climbed up by it.    After a year or two  it came to pass that the kingâ  s son rode through  the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song  which was so  charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel  who in her  solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The kingâ  s  son wanted to climb up to her  and looked for the door of the tower   but none was to be found. He rode home  but the singing had so deeply  touched his heart  that every day he went out into the forest and  listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree  he saw  that an enchantress came there  and he heard how she cried      â  Rapunzel  Rapunzel     Let down your hair to me.â      Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair  and the enchantress  climbed up to her. â  If that is the ladder by which one mounts  I too  will try my fortune â   said he  and the next day when it began to grow  dark  he went to the tower and cried      â  Rapunzel  Rapunzel     Let down your hair to me.â      Immediately the hair fell down and the kingâ  s son climbed up.    At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man  such as her eyes  had never yet beheld  came to her  but the kingâ  s son began to talk to  her quite like a friend  and told her that his heart had been so stirred  that it had let him have no rest  and he had been forced to see her.  Then Rapunzel lost her fear  and when he asked her if she would take  him for her husband  and she saw that he was young and handsome  she  thought  â  He will love me more than old Dame Gothel doesâ    and she said  yes  and laid her hand in his. She said  â  I will willingly go away with  you  but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk  every time that you come  and I will weave a ladder with it  and when  that is ready I will descend  and you will take me on your horse.â   They  agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening  for the  old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this  until  once Rapunzel said to her  â  Tell me  Dame Gothel  how it happens that  you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young kingâ  s son  he  is with me in a moment.â   â  Ah  you wicked child â   cried the enchantress.  â  What do I hear you say  I thought I had separated you from all  the world  and yet you have deceived me â   In her anger she clutched  Rapunzelâ  s beautiful tresses  wrapped them twice round her left hand   seized a pair of scissors with the right  and snip  snap  they were cut  off  and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless  that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great  grief and misery.    On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel  however  the enchantress  fastened the braids of hair  which she had cut off  to the hook of the  window  and when the kingâ  s son came and cried      â  Rapunzel  Rapunzel     Let down your hair to me.â      she let the hair down. The kingâ  s son ascended  but instead of finding  his dearest Rapunzel  he found the enchantress  who gazed at him with  wicked and venomous looks. â  Aha â   she cried mockingly  â  you would fetch  your dearest  but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest   the cat has got it  and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is  lost to you  you will never see her again.â   The kingâ  s son was beside  himself with pain  and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He  escaped with his life  but the thorns into which he fell pierced his  eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest  ate nothing but  roots and berries  and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of  his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years  and at  length came to the desert where Rapunzel  with the twins to which she  had given birth  a boy and a girl  lived in wretchedness. He heard a  voice  and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it  and  when he approached  Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two  of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again  and he could  see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was  joyfully received  and they lived for a long time afterwards  happy and  contented.          FUNDEVOGEL      There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt  and as  he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were  there. He followed the sound  and at last came to a high tree  and at  the top of this a little child was sitting  for the mother had fallen  asleep under the tree with the child  and a bird of prey had seen it in  her arms  had flown down  snatched it away  and set it on the high tree.    The forester climbed up  brought the child down  and thought to himself   â  You will take him home with you  and bring him up with your Lina.â   He  took it home  therefore  and the two children grew up together. And the  one  which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel  because a bird  had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that  when they did not see each other they were sad.    Now the forester had an old cook  who one evening took two pails and  began to fetch water  and did not go once only  but many times  out  to the spring. Lina saw this and said  â  Listen  old Sanna  why are you  fetching so much water â   â  If you will never repeat it to anyone  I will  tell you why.â   So Lina said  no  she would never repeat it to anyone   and then the cook said  â  Early tomorrow morning  when the forester  is out hunting  I will heat the water  and when it is boiling in the  kettle  I will throw in Fundevogel  and will boil him in it.â      Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting  and when he  was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel   â  If you will never leave me  I too will never leave you.â   Fundevogel  said  â  Neither now  nor ever will I leave you.â   Then said Lina  â  Then  will I tell you. Last night  old Sanna carried so many buckets of water  into the house that I asked her why she was doing that  and she said  that if I would promise not to tell anyone  and she said that early  tomorrow morning when father was out hunting  she would set the kettle  full of water  throw you into it and boil you  but we will get up  quickly  dress ourselves  and go away together.â      The two children therefore got up  dressed themselves quickly  and went  away. When the water in the kettle was boiling  the cook went into the  bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in   and went to the beds  both the children were gone. Then she was terribly  alarmed  and she said to herself  â  What shall I say now when the  forester comes home and sees that the children are gone  They must be  followed instantly to get them back again.â      Then the cook sent three servants after them  who were to run and  overtake the children. The children  however  were sitting outside the  forest  and when they saw from afar the three servants running  Lina  said to Fundevogel  â  Never leave me  and I will never leave you.â    Fundevogel said  â  Neither now  nor ever.â   Then said Lina  â  Do you become  a rose tree  and I the rose upon it.â   When the three servants came to  the forest  nothing was there but a rose tree and one rose on it  but  the children were nowhere. Then said they  â  There is nothing to be done  here â   and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing  in the forest but a little rose bush with one rose on it. Then the  old cook scolded and said  â  You simpletons  you should have cut the  rose bush in two  and have broken off the rose and brought it home with  you  go  and do it at once.â   They had therefore to go out and look for  the second time. The children  however  saw them coming from a distance.  Then Lina said  â  Fundevogel  never leave me  and I will never leave  you.â   Fundevogel said  â  Neither now  nor ever.â   Said Lina  â  Then do you  become a church  and Iâ  ll be the chandelier in it.â   So when the three  servants came  nothing was there but a church  with a chandelier in  it. They said therefore to each other  â  What can we do here  let us go  home.â   When they got home  the cook asked if they had not found them   so they said no  they had found nothing but a church  and there was a  chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said  â  You fools  why  did you not pull the church to pieces  and bring the chandelier home  with you â   And now the old cook herself got on her legs  and went with  the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children  however   saw from afar that the three servants were coming  and the cook waddling  after them. Then said Lina  â  Fundevogel  never leave me  and I will  never leave you.â   Then said Fundevogel  â  Neither now  nor ever.â    Said Lina  â  Be a fishpond  and I will be the duck upon it.â   The cook   however  came up to them  and when she saw the pond she lay down by it   and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her  seized  her head in its beak and drew her into the water  and there the old  witch had to drown. Then the children went home together  and were  heartily delighted  and if they have not died  they are living still.          THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR      One summerâ  s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the  window  he was in good spirits  and sewed with all his might. Then came  a peasant woman down the street crying  â  Good jams  cheap  Good jams   cheap â   This rang pleasantly in the tailorâ  s ears  he stretched his  delicate head out of the window  and called  â  Come up here  dear woman   here you will get rid of your goods.â   The woman came up the three steps  to the tailor with her heavy basket  and he made her unpack all the pots  for him. He inspected each one  lifted it up  put his nose to it  and  at length said  â  The jam seems to me to be good  so weigh me out four  ounces  dear woman  and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no  consequence.â   The woman who had hoped to find a good sale  gave him  what he desired  but went away quite angry and grumbling. â  Now  this jam  shall be blessed by God â   cried the little tailor  â  and give me health  and strengthâ    so he brought the bread out of the cupboard  cut himself  a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. â  This wonâ  t  taste bitter â   said he  â  but I will just finish the jacket before I  take a bite.â   He laid the bread near him  sewed on  and in his joy  made  bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam  rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers  and they were  attracted and descended on it in hosts. â  Hi  who invited you â   said the  little tailor  and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies  however   who understood no German  would not be turned away  but came back  again in ever increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all  patience  and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work table   and saying  â  Wait  and I will give it to you â   struck it mercilessly on  them. When he drew it away and counted  there lay before him no fewer  than seven  dead and with legs stretched out. â  Are you a fellow of that  sort â   said he  and could not help admiring his own bravery. â  The whole  town shall know of this â   And the little tailor hastened to cut himself  a girdle  stitched it  and embroidered on it in large letters  â  Seven at  one stroke â   â  What  the town â   he continued  â  the whole world shall hear  of it â   and his heart wagged with joy like a lambâ  s tail. The tailor  put on the girdle  and resolved to go forth into the world  because he  thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away   he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could  take with him  however  he found nothing but an old cheese  and that  he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which  had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the  cheese. Now he took to the road boldly  and as he was light and nimble   he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain  and when he had  reached the highest point of it  there sat a powerful giant looking  peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up  spoke to him   and said  â  Good day  comrade  so you are sitting there overlooking the  wide spread world  I am just on my way thither  and want to try my luck.  Have you any inclination to go with me â   The giant looked contemptuously  at the tailor  and said  â  You ragamuffin  You miserable creature â      â  Oh  indeed â   answered the little tailor  and unbuttoned his coat  and  showed the giant the girdle  â  there may you read what kind of a man I  am â   The giant read  â  Seven at one stroke â   and thought that they had  been men whom the tailor had killed  and began to feel a little respect  for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless  he wished to try him first  and took  a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out  of it. â  Do that likewise â   said the giant  â  if you have strength.â   â  Is  that all â   said the tailor  â  that is childâ  s play with us â   and put his  hand into his pocket  brought out the soft cheese  and pressed it until  the liquid ran out of it. â  Faith â   said he  â  that was a little better   wasnâ  t it â   The giant did not know what to say  and could not believe it  of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high  that the eye could scarcely follow it. â  Now  little mite of a man  do  that likewise â   â  Well thrown â   said the tailor  â  but after all the stone  came down to earth again  I will throw you one which shall never come  back at all â   and he put his hand into his pocket  took out the bird   and threw it into the air. The bird  delighted with its liberty   rose  flew away and did not come back. â  How does that shot please you   comrade â   asked the tailor. â  You can certainly throw â   said the giant   â  but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.â   He  took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on  the ground  and said  â  If you are strong enough  help me to carry the  tree out of the forest.â   â  Readily â   answered the little man  â  take you  the trunk on your shoulders  and I will raise up the branches and twigs   after all  they are the heaviest.â   The giant took the trunk on his  shoulder  but the tailor seated himself on a branch  and the giant  who  could not look round  had to carry away the whole tree  and the little  tailor into the bargain  he behind  was quite merry and happy  and  whistled the song  â  Three tailors rode forth from the gate â   as if  carrying the tree were childâ  s play. The giant  after he had dragged the  heavy burden part of the way  could go no further  and cried  â  Hark  you  I shall have to let the tree fall â   The tailor sprang nimbly down   seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it  and said  to the giant  â  You are such a great fellow  and yet cannot even carry  the tree â      They went on together  and as they passed a cherry tree  the giant laid  hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging  bent it  down  gave it into the tailorâ  s hand  and bade him eat. But the little  tailor was much too weak to hold the tree  and when the giant let it go   it sprang back again  and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.  When he had fallen down again without injury  the giant said  â  What is  this  Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig â   â  There is no  lack of strength â   answered the little tailor. â  Do you think that could  be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow  I leapt over  the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.  Jump as I did  if you can do it.â   The giant made the attempt but he  could not get over the tree  and remained hanging in the branches  so  that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.    The giant said  â  If you are such a valiant fellow  come with me into our  cavern and spend the night with us.â   The little tailor was willing  and  followed him. When they went into the cave  other giants were sitting  there by the fire  and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and  was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought  â  It is much  more spacious here than in my workshop.â   The giant showed him a bed  and  said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed  however  was too  big for the little tailor  he did not lie down in it  but crept into  a corner. When it was midnight  and the giant thought that the little  tailor was lying in a sound sleep  he got up  took a great iron bar   cut through the bed with one blow  and thought he had finished off the  grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the  forest  and had quite forgotten the little tailor  when all at once he  walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified   they were afraid that he would strike them all dead  and ran away in a  great hurry.    The little tailor went onwards  always following his own pointed nose.  After he had walked for a long time  he came to the courtyard of a royal  palace  and as he felt weary  he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.  Whilst he lay there  the people came and inspected him on all sides  and  read on his girdle  â  Seven at one stroke.â   â  Ah â   said they  â  what does  the great warrior want here in the midst of peace  He must be a mighty  lord.â   They went and announced him to the king  and gave it as their  opinion that if war should break out  this would be a weighty and useful  man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased  the king  and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer  him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by  the sleeper  waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes   and then conveyed to him this proposal. â  For this very reason have  I come here â   the tailor replied  â  I am ready to enter the kingâ  s  service.â   He was therefore honourably received  and a special dwelling  was assigned him.    The soldiers  however  were set against the little tailor  and wished  him a thousand miles away. â  What is to be the end of this â   they said  among themselves. â  If we quarrel with him  and he strikes about him   seven of us will fall at every blow  not one of us can stand against  him.â   They came therefore to a decision  betook themselves in a body to  the king  and begged for their dismissal. â  We are not prepared â   said  they  â  to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.â   The king was  sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants   wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor  and would willingly  have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his  dismissal  for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people  dead  and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a  long time  and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor  and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior  he had one  request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants   who caused great mischief with their robbing  murdering  ravaging   and burning  and no one could approach them without putting himself in  danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants  he  would give him his only daughter to wife  and half of his kingdom as a  dowry  likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.  â  That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me â   thought the  little tailor. â  One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a  kingdom every day of oneâ  s life â   â  Oh  yes â   he replied  â  I will soon  subdue the giants  and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen  to do it  he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of  two.â      The little tailor went forth  and the hundred horsemen followed him.  When he came to the outskirts of the forest  he said to his followers   â  Just stay waiting here  I alone will soon finish off the giants.â   Then  he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a  while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree  and  snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor  not  idle  gathered two pocketsful of stones  and with these climbed up the  tree. When he was halfway up  he slipped down by a branch  until he sat  just above the sleepers  and then let one stone after another fall on  the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing   but at last he awoke  pushed his comrade  and said  â  Why are you  knocking me â   â  You must be dreaming â   said the other  â  I am not knocking  you.â   They laid themselves down to sleep again  and then the tailor  threw a stone down on the second. â  What is the meaning of this â   cried  the other â  Why are you pelting me â   â  I am not pelting you â   answered  the first  growling. They disputed about it for a time  but as they were  weary they let the matter rest  and their eyes closed once more. The  little tailor began his game again  picked out the biggest stone  and  threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. â  That  is too bad â   cried he  and sprang up like a madman  and pushed his  companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in  the same coin  and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and  belaboured each other so long  that at last they both fell down dead on  the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. â  It is  a lucky thing â   said he  â  that they did not tear up the tree on which  I was sitting  or I should have had to sprint on to another like a  squirrel  but we tailors are nimble.â   He drew out his sword and gave  each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast  and then went out to the  horsemen and said  â  The work is done  I have finished both of them  off  but it was hard work  They tore up trees in their sore need  and  defended themselves with them  but all that is to no purpose when a man  like myself comes  who can kill seven at one blow.â   â  But are you not  wounded â   asked the horsemen. â  You need not concern yourself about  that â   answered the tailor  â  they have not bent one hair of mine.â   The  horsemen would not believe him  and rode into the forest  there they  found the giants swimming in their blood  and all round about lay the  torn up trees.    The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward  he  however   repented of his promise  and again bethought himself how he could get  rid of the hero. â  Before you receive my daughter  and the half of my  kingdom â   said he to him  â  you must perform one more heroic deed. In  the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm  and you must catch  it first.â   â  I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one  blow  is my kind of affair.â   He took a rope and an axe with him  went  forth into the forest  and again bade those who were sent with him to  wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards  him  and rushed directly on the tailor  as if it would gore him with its  horn without more ado. â  Softly  softly  it canâ  t be done as quickly as  that â   said he  and stood still and waited until the animal was quite  close  and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against  the tree with all its strength  and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk  that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again  and thus it  was caught. â  Now  I have got the bird â   said the tailor  and came out  from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck  and then with his  axe he hewed the horn out of the tree  and when all was ready he led the  beast away and took it to the king.    The king still would not give him the promised reward  and made a third  demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that  made great havoc in the forest  and the huntsmen should give him their  help. â  Willingly â   said the tailor  â  that is childâ  s play â   He did not  take the huntsmen with him into the forest  and they were well pleased  that he did not  for the wild boar had several times received them in  such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When  the boar perceived the tailor  it ran on him with foaming mouth and  whetted tusks  and was about to throw him to the ground  but the hero  fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at  once  and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him  but the tailor  ran round outside and shut the door behind it  and then the raging  beast  which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window   was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they  might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero  however  went to  the king  who was now  whether he liked it or not  obliged to keep his  promise  and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known  that it was no warlike hero  but a little tailor who was standing before  him  it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding  was held with great magnificence and small joy  and out of a tailor a  king was made.    After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at  night  â  Boy  make me the doublet  and patch the pantaloons  or else I  will rap the yard measure over your ears.â   Then she discovered in what  state of life the young lord had been born  and next morning complained  of her wrongs to her father  and begged him to help her to get rid of  her husband  who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her  and said  â  Leave your bedroom door open this night  and my servants  shall stand outside  and when he has fallen asleep shall go in  bind  him  and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide  world.â   The woman was satisfied with this  but the kingâ  s armour bearer   who had heard all  was friendly with the young lord  and informed him of  the whole plot. â  Iâ  ll put a screw into that business â   said the little  tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time  and  when she thought that he had fallen asleep  she got up  opened the door   and then lay down again. The little tailor  who was only pretending to  be asleep  began to cry out in a clear voice  â  Boy  make me the doublet  and patch me the pantaloons  or I will rap the yard measure over your  ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants  I brought away one  unicorn  and caught a wild boar  and am I to fear those who are standing  outside the room.â   When these men heard the tailor speaking thus  they  were overcome by a great dread  and ran as if the wild huntsman were  behind them  and none of them would venture anything further against  him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his  life.          HANSEL AND GRETEL      Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood cutter with his wife and his  two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had  little to bite and to break  and once when great dearth fell on the  land  he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought  over this by night in his bed  and tossed about in his anxiety  he  groaned and said to his wife  â  What is to become of us  How are we  to feed our poor children  when we no longer have anything even for  ourselves â   â  Iâ  ll tell you what  husband â   answered the woman  â  early  tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where  it is the thickest  there we will light a fire for them  and give each  of them one more piece of bread  and then we will go to our work and  leave them alone. They will not find the way home again  and we shall be  rid of them.â   â  No  wife â   said the man  â  I will not do that  how can I  bear to leave my children alone in the forest   the wild animals would  soon come and tear them to pieces.â   â  O  you fool â   said she  â  then we  must all four die of hunger  you may as well plane the planks for our  coffins â   and she left him no peace until he consented. â  But I feel very  sorry for the poor children  all the same â   said the man.    The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger  and had  heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept  bitter tears  and said to Hansel  â  Now all is over with us.â   â  Be quiet   Gretel â   said Hansel  â  do not distress yourself  I will soon find a way  to help us.â   And when the old folks had fallen asleep  he got up  put  on his little coat  opened the door below  and crept outside. The moon  shone brightly  and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house  glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the  little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went  back and said to Gretel  â  Be comforted  dear little sister  and sleep in  peace  God will not forsake us â   and he lay down again in his bed. When  day dawned  but before the sun had risen  the woman came and awoke the  two children  saying  â  Get up  you sluggards  we are going into the  forest to fetch wood.â   She gave each a little piece of bread  and said   â  There is something for your dinner  but do not eat it up before then   for you will get nothing else.â   Gretel took the bread under her apron   as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together  on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time  Hansel  stood still and peeped back at the house  and did so again and again.  His father said  â  Hansel  what are you looking at there and staying  behind for  Pay attention  and do not forget how to use your legs.â   â  Ah   father â   said Hansel  â  I am looking at my little white cat  which is  sitting up on the roof  and wants to say goodbye to me.â   The wife said   â  Fool  that is not your little cat  that is the morning sun which is  shining on the chimneys.â   Hansel  however  had not been looking back at  the cat  but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble stones  out of his pocket on the road.    When they had reached the middle of the forest  the father said  â  Now   children  pile up some wood  and I will light a fire that you may not  be cold.â   Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together  as high as a  little hill. The brushwood was lighted  and when the flames were burning  very high  the woman said  â  Now  children  lay yourselves down by the  fire and rest  we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we  have done  we will come back and fetch you away.â      Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire  and when noon came  each ate a little  piece of bread  and as they heard the strokes of the wood axe they  believed that their father was near. It was not the axe  however  but  a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was  blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long  time  their eyes closed with fatigue  and they fell fast asleep. When  at last they awoke  it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and  said  â  How are we to get out of the forest now â   But Hansel comforted  her and said  â  Just wait a little  until the moon has risen  and then we  will soon find the way.â   And when the full moon had risen  Hansel took  his little sister by the hand  and followed the pebbles which shone like  newly coined silver pieces  and showed them the way.    They walked the whole night long  and by break of day came once more  to their fatherâ  s house. They knocked at the door  and when the woman  opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel  she said  â  You naughty  children  why have you slept so long in the forest   we thought you were  never coming back at all â   The father  however  rejoiced  for it had cut  him to the heart to leave them behind alone.    Not long afterwards  there was once more great dearth throughout the  land  and the children heard their mother saying at night to their  father  â  Everything is eaten again  we have one half loaf left  and that  is the end. The children must go  we will take them farther into the  wood  so that they will not find their way out again  there is no other  means of saving ourselves â   The manâ  s heart was heavy  and he thought   â  It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your  children.â   The woman  however  would listen to nothing that he had to  say  but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B  likewise   and as he had yielded the first time  he had to do so a second time  also.    The children  however  were still awake and had heard the conversation.  When the old folks were asleep  Hansel again got up  and wanted to go  out and pick up pebbles as he had done before  but the woman had locked  the door  and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his  little sister  and said  â  Do not cry  Gretel  go to sleep quietly  the  good God will help us.â      Early in the morning came the woman  and took the children out of their  beds. Their piece of bread was given to them  but it was still smaller  than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his  in his pocket  and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.  â  Hansel  why do you stop and look round â   said the father  â  go on.â   â  I  am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof  and  wants to say goodbye to me â   answered Hansel. â  Fool â   said the woman   â  that is not your little pigeon  that is the morning sun that is shining  on the chimney.â   Hansel  however little by little  threw all the crumbs  on the path.    The woman led the children still deeper into the forest  where they had  never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made  and  the mother said  â  Just sit there  you children  and when you are tired  you may sleep a little  we are going into the forest to cut wood  and in  the evening when we are done  we will come and fetch you away.â   When  it was noon  Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel  who had  scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed  but  no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark  night  and Hansel comforted his little sister and said  â  Just wait   Gretel  until the moon rises  and then we shall see the crumbs of bread  which I have strewn about  they will show us our way home again.â   When  the moon came they set out  but they found no crumbs  for the many  thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked  them all up. Hansel said to Gretel  â  We shall soon find the way â   but  they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day  too from morning till evening  but they did not get out of the forest   and were very hungry  for they had nothing to eat but two or three  berries  which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their  legs would carry them no longer  they lay down beneath a tree and fell  asleep.    It was now three mornings since they had left their fatherâ  s house. They  began to walk again  but they always came deeper into the forest  and if  help did not come soon  they must die of hunger and weariness. When it  was mid day  they saw a beautiful snow white bird sitting on a bough   which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And  when its song was over  it spread its wings and flew away before them   and they followed it until they reached a little house  on the roof of  which it alighted  and when they approached the little house they saw  that it was built of bread and covered with cakes  but that the windows  were of clear sugar. â  We will set to work on that â   said Hansel  â  and  have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof  and you Gretel  can eat  some of the window  it will taste sweet.â   Hansel reached up above  and  broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted  and Gretel leant  against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried  from the parlour      â  Nibble  nibble  gnaw     Who is nibbling at my little house â      The children answered      â  The wind  the wind     The heaven born wind â      and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel  who liked the  taste of the roof  tore down a great piece of it  and Gretel pushed out  the whole of one round window pane  sat down  and enjoyed herself with  it. Suddenly the door opened  and a woman as old as the hills  who  supported herself on crutches  came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were  so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their  hands. The old woman  however  nodded her head  and said  â  Oh  you dear  children  who has brought you here  do come in  and stay with me. No  harm shall happen to you.â   She took them both by the hand  and led them  into her little house. Then good food was set before them  milk and  pancakes  with sugar  apples  and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little  beds were covered with clean white linen  and Hansel and Gretel lay down  in them  and thought they were in heaven.    The old woman had only pretended to be so kind  she was in reality  a wicked witch  who lay in wait for children  and had only built the  little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell  into her power  she killed it  cooked and ate it  and that was a feast  day with her. Witches have red eyes  and cannot see far  but they have  a keen scent like the beasts  and are aware when human beings draw near.  When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood  she laughed with  malice  and said mockingly  â  I have them  they shall not escape me  again â   Early in the morning before the children were awake  she was  already up  and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so  pretty  with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself  â  That  will be a dainty mouthful â   Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled  hand  carried him into a little stable  and locked him in behind a  grated door. Scream as he might  it would not help him. Then she went to  Gretel  shook her till she awoke  and cried  â  Get up  lazy thing  fetch  some water  and cook something good for your brother  he is in the  stable outside  and is to be made fat. When he is fat  I will eat him.â    Gretel began to weep bitterly  but it was all in vain  for she was  forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.    And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel  but Gretel got nothing  but crab shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable  and  cried  â  Hansel  stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon  be fat.â   Hansel  however  stretched out a little bone to her  and  the old woman  who had dim eyes  could not see it  and thought it was  Hanselâ  s finger  and was astonished that there was no way of fattening  him. When four weeks had gone by  and Hansel still remained thin  she  was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. â  Now  then   Gretel â   she cried to the girl  â  stir yourself  and bring some water.  Let Hansel be fat or lean  tomorrow I will kill him  and cook him.â   Ah   how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water   and how her tears did flow down her cheeks  â  Dear God  do help us â   she  cried. â  If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us  we should  at any rate have died together.â   â  Just keep your noise to yourself â    said the old woman  â  it wonâ  t help you at all.â      Early in the morning  Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with  the water  and light the fire. â  We will bake first â   said the old woman   â  I have already heated the oven  and kneaded the dough.â   She pushed poor  Gretel out to the oven  from which flames of fire were already darting.  â  Creep in â   said the witch  â  and see if it is properly heated  so that  we can put the bread in.â   And once Gretel was inside  she intended to  shut the oven and let her bake in it  and then she would eat her  too.  But Gretel saw what she had in mind  and said  â  I do not know how I am  to do it  how do I get in â   â  Silly goose â   said the old woman. â  The door  is big enough  just look  I can get in myself â   and she crept up and  thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove  her far into it  and shut the iron door  and fastened the bolt. Oh  then  she began to howl quite horribly  but Gretel ran away and the godless  witch was miserably burnt to death.    Gretel  however  ran like lightning to Hansel  opened his little stable   and cried  â  Hansel  we are saved  The old witch is dead â   Then Hansel  sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did  rejoice and embrace each other  and dance about and kiss each other  And  as they had no longer any need to fear her  they went into the witchâ  s  house  and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.  â  These are far better than pebbles â   said Hansel  and thrust into his  pockets whatever could be got in  and Gretel said  â  I  too  will take  something home with me â   and filled her pinafore full. â  But now we must  be off â   said Hansel  â  that we may get out of the witchâ  s forest.â      When they had walked for two hours  they came to a great stretch of  water. â  We cannot cross â   said Hansel  â  I see no foot plank  and no  bridge.â   â  And there is also no ferry â   answered Gretel  â  but a white  duck is swimming there  if I ask her  she will help us over.â   Then she  cried      â  Little duck  little duck  dost thou see     Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee     Thereâ  s never a plank  or bridge in sight     Take us across on thy back so white.â      The duck came to them  and Hansel seated himself on its back  and told  his sister to sit by him. â  No â   replied Gretel  â  that will be too heavy  for the little duck  she shall take us across  one after the other.â   The  good little duck did so  and when they were once safely across and had  walked for a short time  the forest seemed to be more and more familiar  to them  and at length they saw from afar their fatherâ  s house. Then  they began to run  rushed into the parlour  and threw themselves round  their fatherâ  s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had  left the children in the forest  the woman  however  was dead. Gretel  emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the  room  and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to  add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end  and they lived together  in perfect happiness. My tale is done  there runs a mouse  whosoever  catches it  may make himself a big fur cap out of it.          THE MOUSE  THE BIRD  AND THE SAUSAGE      Once upon a time  a mouse  a bird  and a sausage  entered into  partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well   they lived in great comfort  and prospered so far as to be able to add  considerably to their stores. The birdâ  s duty was to fly daily into the  wood and bring in fuel  the mouse fetched the water  and the sausage saw  to the cooking.    When people are too well off they always begin to long for something  new. And so it came to pass  that the bird  while out one day  met a  fellow bird  to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his  household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a  poor simpleton  who did all the hard work  while the other two stayed  at home and had a good time of it. For  when the mouse had made the fire  and fetched in the water  she could retire into her little room and rest  until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the  pot to see that the food was properly cooked  and when it was near  dinner time  he just threw himself into the broth  or rolled in and out  among the vegetables three or four times  and there they were  buttered   and salted  and ready to be served. Then  when the bird came home and  had laid aside his burden  they sat down to table  and when they had  finished their meal  they could sleep their fill till the following  morning  and that was really a very delightful life.    Influenced by those remarks  the bird next morning refused to bring in  the wood  telling the others that he had been their servant long enough   and had been a fool into the bargain  and that it was now time to make a  change  and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray  as the mouse and the sausage might  it was of no use  the bird remained  master of the situation  and the venture had to be made. They therefore  drew lots  and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood  to the mouse  to cook  and to the bird to fetch the water.    And now what happened  The sausage started in search of wood  the bird  made the fire  and the mouse put on the pot  and then these two waited  till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the  sausage remained so long away  that they became uneasy  and the bird  flew out to meet him. He had not flown far  however  when he came across  a dog who  having met the sausage  had regarded him as his legitimate  booty  and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog  of this bare faced robbery  but nothing he said was of any avail  for  the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage  and  that was the reason his life had been forfeited.    He picked up the wood  and flew sadly home  and told the mouse all he  had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy  but agreed to make the  best of things and to remain with one another.    So now the bird set the table  and the mouse looked after the food and   wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage  by rolling in and  out among the vegetables to salt and butter them  she jumped into the  pot  but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom  having  already parted not only with her skin and hair  but also with life.    Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner  but he  could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry  he threw the wood  here and there about the floor  called and searched  but no cook was to  be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down   caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water   but his pail fell into the well  and he after it  and as he was unable  to recover himself  he was drowned.          MOTHER HOLLE      Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters  one of them  was beautiful and industrious  the other ugly and lazy. The mother   however  loved the ugly and lazy one best  because she was her own  daughter  and so the other  who was only her stepdaughter  was made  to do all the work of the house  and was quite the Cinderella of the  family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in  the high road  there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it  chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle  and as the girl  stopped over the well to wash it off  the spindle suddenly sprang out  of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her  misfortune  but her stepmother spoke harshly to her  and after giving  her a violent scolding  said unkindly  â  As you have let the spindle fall  into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.â      The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do  and at last in  her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.    She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a  beautiful meadow  full of sunshine  and with countless flowers blooming  in every direction.    She walked over the meadow  and presently she came upon a bakerâ  s oven  full of bread  and the loaves cried out to her  â  Take us out  take us  out  or alas  we shall be burnt to a cinder  we were baked through long  ago.â   So she took the bread shovel and drew them all out.    She went on a little farther  till she came to a tree full of apples.  â  Shake me  shake me  I pray â   cried the tree  â  my apples  one and all   are ripe.â   So she shook the tree  and the apples came falling down upon  her like rain  but she continued shaking until there was not a single  apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a  heap and walked on again.    The next thing she came to was a little house  and there she saw an old  woman looking out  with such large teeth  that she was terrified  and  turned to run away. But the old woman called after her  â  What are you  afraid of  dear child  Stay with me  if you will do the work of my house  properly for me  I will make you very happy. You must be very careful   however  to make my bed in the right way  for I wish you always to shake  it thoroughly  so that the feathers fly about  then they say  down there  in the world  that it is snowing  for I am Mother Holle.â   The old woman  spoke so kindly  that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter  into her service.    She took care to do everything according to the old womanâ  s bidding and  every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might  so that the  feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good  as her word  she never spoke angrily to her  and gave her roast and  boiled meats every day.    So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time  and then she began  to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad  but she  became conscious at last of great longing to go home  then she knew she  was homesick  although she was a thousand times better off with Mother  Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile  she went  to Mother Holle and said  â  I am so homesick  that I cannot stay with  you any longer  for although I am so happy here  I must return to my own  people.â      Then Mother Holle said  â  I am pleased that you should want to go back  to your own people  and as you have served me so well and faithfully  I  will take you home myself.â      Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate  was opened  and as the girl passed through  a shower of gold fell upon  her  and the gold clung to her  so that she was covered with it from  head to foot.    â  That is a reward for your industry â   said Mother Holle  and as she  spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.    The gate was then closed  and the girl found herself back in the old  world close to her motherâ  s house. As she entered the courtyard  the  cock who was perched on the well  called out      â  Cock a doodle doo     Your golden daughterâ  s come back to you.â      Then she went in to her mother and sister  and as she was so richly  covered with gold  they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them  all that had happened  and when the mother heard how she had come by her  great riches  she thought she should like her ugly  lazy daughter to go  and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well  and spin  and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a  thorn bush  so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle  then  she threw it into the well  and jumped in herself.    Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow  and walked over it  till she came to the oven. â  Take us out  take us out  or alas  we shall  be burnt to a cinder  we were baked through long ago â   cried the loaves  as before. But the lazy girl answered  â  Do you think I am going to dirty  my hands for you â   and walked on.    Presently she came to the apple tree. â  Shake me  shake me  I pray  my  apples  one and all  are ripe â   it cried. But she only answered  â  A nice  thing to ask me to do  one of the apples might fall on my head â   and  passed on.    At last she came to Mother Holleâ  s house  and as she had heard all about  the large teeth from her sister  she was not afraid of them  and engaged  herself without delay to the old woman.    The first day she was very obedient and industrious  and exerted herself  to please Mother Holle  for she thought of the gold she should get in  return. The next day  however  she began to dawdle over her work  and  the third day she was more idle still  then she began to lie in bed in  the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still  she neglected to  make the old womanâ  s bed properly  and forgot to shake it so that the  feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her   and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this  and  thought to herself  â  The gold will soon be mine.â   Mother Holle led her   as she had led her sister  to the broad gateway  but as she was passing  through  instead of the shower of gold  a great bucketful of pitch came  pouring over her.    â  That is in return for your services â   said the old woman  and she shut  the gate.    So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch  and the cock on the  well called out as she saw her      â  Cock a doodle doo     Your dirty daughterâ  s come back to you.â      But  try what she would  she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to  her as long as she lived.          LITTLE RED CAP  LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD       Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone  who looked at her  but most of all by her grandmother  and there was  nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a  little cap of red velvet  which suited her so well that she would never  wear anything else  so she was always called â  Little Red Cap.â      One day her mother said to her  â  Come  Little Red Cap  here is a piece  of cake and a bottle of wine  take them to your grandmother  she is ill  and weak  and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot  and  when you are going  walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path   or you may fall and break the bottle  and then your grandmother will  get nothing  and when you go into her room  donâ  t forget to say  â  Good  morningâ    and donâ  t peep into every corner before you do it.â      â  I will take great care â   said Little Red Cap to her mother  and gave  her hand on it.    The grandmother lived out in the wood  half a league from the village   and just as Little Red Cap entered the wood  a wolf met her. Red Cap  did not know what a wicked creature he was  and was not at all afraid of  him.    â  Good day  Little Red Cap â   said he.    â  Thank you kindly  wolf.â      â  Whither away so early  Little Red Cap â      â  To my grandmotherâ  s.â      â  What have you got in your apron â      â  Cake and wine  yesterday was baking day  so poor sick grandmother is to  have something good  to make her stronger.â      â  Where does your grandmother live  Little Red Cap â      â  A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood  her house stands  under the three large oak trees  the nut trees are just below  you  surely must know it â   replied Little Red Cap.    The wolf thought to himself  â  What a tender young creature  what a nice  plump mouthful  she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must  act craftily  so as to catch both.â   So he walked for a short time by  the side of Little Red Cap  and then he said  â  See  Little Red Cap  how  pretty the flowers are about here  why do you not look round  I believe   too  that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing  you  walk gravely along as if you were going to school  while everything else  out here in the wood is merry.â      Little Red Cap raised her eyes  and when she saw the sunbeams dancing  here and there through the trees  and pretty flowers growing everywhere   she thought  â  Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay  that would  please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there  in good timeâ    and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for  flowers. And whenever she had picked one  she fancied that she saw a  still prettier one farther on  and ran after it  and so got deeper and  deeper into the wood.    Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmotherâ  s house and knocked  at the door.    â  Who is there â      â  Little Red Cap â   replied the wolf. â  She is bringing cake and wine  open  the door.â      â  Lift the latch â   called out the grandmother  â  I am too weak  and cannot  get up.â      The wolf lifted the latch  the door sprang open  and without saying a  word he went straight to the grandmotherâ  s bed  and devoured her. Then  he put on her clothes  dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed  and drew the curtains.    Little Red Cap  however  had been running about picking flowers   and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more  she  remembered her grandmother  and set out on the way to her.    She was surprised to find the cottage door standing open  and when she  went into the room  she had such a strange feeling that she said to  herself  â  Oh dear  how uneasy I feel today  and at other times I like  being with grandmother so much.â   She called out  â  Good morning â   but  received no answer  so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face  and  looking very strange.    â  Oh  grandmother â   she said  â  what big ears you have â      â  The better to hear you with  my child â   was the reply.    â  But  grandmother  what big eyes you have â   she said.    â  The better to see you with  my dear.â      â  But  grandmother  what large hands you have â      â  The better to hug you with.â      â  Oh  but  grandmother  what a terrible big mouth you have â      â  The better to eat you with â      And scarcely had the wolf said this  than with one bound he was out of  bed and swallowed up Red Cap.    When the wolf had appeased his appetite  he lay down again in the bed   fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing  the house  and thought to himself  â  How the old woman is snoring  I must  just see if she wants anything.â   So he went into the room  and when he  came to the bed  he saw that the wolf was lying in it. â  Do I find you  here  you old sinner â   said he. â  I have long sought you â   Then just as  he was going to fire at him  it occurred to him that the wolf might have  devoured the grandmother  and that she might still be saved  so he did  not fire  but took a pair of scissors  and began to cut open the stomach  of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips  he saw the little  Red Cap shining  and then he made two snips more  and the little girl  sprang out  crying  â  Ah  how frightened I have been  How dark it was  inside the wolfâ    and after that the aged grandmother came out alive  also  but scarcely able to breathe. Red Cap  however  quickly fetched  great stones with which they filled the wolfâ  s belly  and when he awoke   he wanted to run away  but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at  once  and fell dead.    Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolfâ  s skin and  went home with it  the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which  Red Cap had brought  and revived  but Red Cap thought to herself  â  As  long as I live  I will never by myself leave the path  to run into the  wood  when my mother has forbidden me to do so.â        It also related that once when Red Cap was again taking cakes to the old  grandmother  another wolf spoke to her  and tried to entice her from the  path. Red Cap  however  was on her guard  and went straight forward on  her way  and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf  and that he  had said â  good morningâ   to her  but with such a wicked look in his eyes   that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would  have eaten her up. â  Well â   said the grandmother  â  we will shut the door   that he may not come in.â   Soon afterwards the wolf knocked  and cried   â  Open the door  grandmother  I am Little Red Cap  and am bringing you  some cakes.â   But they did not speak  or open the door  so the grey beard  stole twice or thrice round the house  and at last jumped on the roof   intending to wait until Red Cap went home in the evening  and then to  steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother  saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone  trough  so she said to the child  â  Take the pail  Red Cap  I made some  sausages yesterday  so carry the water in which I boiled them to the  trough.â   Red Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the  smell of the sausages reached the wolf  and he sniffed and peeped down   and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep  his footing and began to slip  and slipped down from the roof straight  into the great trough  and was drowned. But Red Cap went joyously home   and no one ever did anything to harm her again.          THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM      There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter  and as she was  grown up  he was anxious that she should be well married and provided  for. He said to himself  â  I will give her to the first suitable man who  comes and asks for her hand.â   Not long after a suitor appeared  and as  he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with  which to find fault  he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did  not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.  She did not feel that she could trust him  and she could not look at him  nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her  â  You  have not yet paid me a visit  although we have been betrothed for some  time.â   â  I do not know where your house is â   she answered. â  My house is  out there in the dark forest â   he said. She tried to excuse herself by  saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed  only replied  â  You must come and see me next Sunday  I have already  invited guests for that day  and that you may not mistake the way  I  will strew ashes along the path.â      When Sunday came  and it was time for the girl to start  a feeling of  dread came over her which she could not explain  and that she might  be able to find her path again  she filled her pockets with peas and  lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the  entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes  and these  she followed  throwing down some peas on either side of her at every  step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest   darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house  looking so  grim and mysterious  that it did not please her at all. She stepped  inside  but not a soul was to be seen  and a great silence reigned  throughout. Suddenly a voice cried      â  Turn back  turn back  young maiden fair     Linger not in this murderersâ   lair.â      The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a  cage on the wall. Again it cried      â  Turn back  turn back  young maiden fair     Linger not in this murderersâ   lair.â      The girl passed on  going from room to room of the house  but they were  all empty  and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar   and there sat a very  very old woman  who could not keep her head from  shaking. â  Can you tell me â   asked the girl  â  if my betrothed husband  lives here â      â  Ah  you poor child â   answered the old woman  â  what a place for you to  come to  This is a murderersâ   den. You think yourself a promised bride   and that your marriage will soon take place  but it is with death that  you will keep your marriage feast. Look  do you see that large cauldron  of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire  As soon as they have  you in their power they will kill you without mercy  and cook and eat  you  for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save  you  you would be lost.â      Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask  which quite hid her  from view. â  Keep as still as a mouse â   she said  â  do not move or speak   or it will be all over with you. Tonight  when the robbers are  all asleep  we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an  opportunity to escape.â      The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned   dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk  and  paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink   three glasses full  one of white wine  one of red  and one of yellow   and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her  dainty clothing  laid her on a table  and cut her beautiful body into  pieces  and sprinkled salt upon it.    The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the  cask  for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by  the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on  the little finger of the murdered girl  and as he could not draw it off  easily  he took a hatchet and cut off the finger  but the finger sprang  into the air  and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was  hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it  but he  could not find it. â  Have you looked behind the large cask â   said one of  the others. But the old woman called out  â  Come and eat your suppers   and let the thing be till tomorrow  the finger wonâ  t run away.â      â  The old woman is right â   said the robbers  and they ceased looking for  the finger and sat down.    The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine  and before  long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar  fast asleep and  snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this  she came from behind  the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers  who  were lying close together  and every moment she was filled with renewed  dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her  so that she  passed safely over them  and then she and the old woman went upstairs   opened the door  and hastened as fast as they could from the murderersâ    den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind  but the peas and  lentils had sprouted  and grown sufficiently above the ground  to guide  them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked  and it  was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father  all that had happened.    The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom  arrived and also a large company of guests  for the miller had taken  care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast   each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale  the bride sat still and did  not say a word.    â  And you  my love â   said the bridegroom  turning to her  â  is there no  tale you know  Tell us something.â      â  I will tell you a dream  then â   said the bride. â  I went alone through a  forest and came at last to a house  not a soul could I find within  but  a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried      â  Turn back  turn back  young maiden fair     Linger not in this murderersâ   lair.â      and again a second time it said these words.â      â  My darling  this is only a dream.â      â  I went on through the house from room to room  but they were all empty   and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the  cellar  and there sat a very  very old woman  who could not keep her  head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here  and she answered   â  Ah  you poor child  you are come to a murderersâ   den  your betrothed  does indeed live here  but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards  cook and eat you.â  â      â  My darling  this is only a dream.â      â  The old woman hid me behind a large cask  and scarcely had she done  this when the robbers returned home  dragging a young girl along with  them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink  white  red  and  yellow  and with that she died.â      â  My darling  this is only a dream.â      â  Then they tore off her dainty clothing  and cut her beautiful body into  pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.â      â  My darling  this is only a dream.â      â  And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her  finger  and as it was difficult to draw off  he took a hatchet and cut  off her finger  but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the  great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.â   And  with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the  assembled guests.    The bridegroom  who during this recital had grown deadly pale  up and  tried to escape  but the guests seized him and held him fast. They  delivered him up to justice  and he and all his murderous band were  condemned to death for their wicked deeds.          TOM THUMB      A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night  smoking his pipe by the  fireside  while his wife sat by his side spinning. â  How lonely it is   wife â   said he  as he puffed out a long curl of smoke  â  for you and me  to sit here by ourselves  without any children to play about and amuse  us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children â    â  What you say is very true â   said the wife  sighing  and turning round  her wheel  â  how happy should I be if I had but one child  If it were  ever so small  nay  if it were no bigger than my thumb  I should be very  happy  and love it dearly.â   Now  odd as you may think it  it came to  pass that this good womanâ  s wish was fulfilled  just in the very way she  had wished it  for  not long afterwards  she had a little boy  who was  quite healthy and strong  but was not much bigger than my thumb. So  they said  â  Well  we cannot say we have not got what we wished for  and   little as he is  we will love him dearly.â   And they called him Thomas  Thumb.    They gave him plenty of food  yet for all they could do he never grew  bigger  but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.  Still  his eyes were sharp and sparkling  and he soon showed himself to  be a clever little fellow  who always knew well what he was about.    One day  as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut  fuel  he said  â  I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me  for I  want to make haste.â   â  Oh  father â   cried Tom  â  I will take care of that   the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.â   Then the woodman  laughed  and said  â  How can that be  you cannot reach up to the horseâ  s  bridle.â   â  Never mind that  father â   said Tom  â  if my mother will only  harness the horse  I will get into his ear and tell him which way to  go.â   â  Well â   said the father  â  we will try for once.â      When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart  and put  Tom into his ear  and as he sat there the little man told the beast how  to go  crying out  â  Go on â   and â  Stop â   as he wanted  and thus the horse  went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the  wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast  and Tom  was calling out  â  Gently  gently â   two strangers came up. â  What an odd  thing that is â   said one  â  there is a cart going along  and I hear a  carter talking to the horse  but yet I can see no one.â   â  That is queer   indeed â   said the other  â  let us follow the cart  and see where it  goes.â   So they went on into the wood  till at last they came to the  place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb  seeing his father  cried  out  â  See  father  here I am with the cart  all right and safe  now take  me down â   So his father took hold of the horse with one hand  and with  the other took his son out of the horseâ  s ear  and put him down upon a  straw  where he sat as merry as you please.    The two strangers were all this time looking on  and did not know what  to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside  and said  â  That  little urchin will make our fortune  if we can get him  and carry him  about from town to town as a show  we must buy him.â   So they went up to  the woodman  and asked him what he would take for the little man. â  He  will be better off â   said they  â  with us than with you.â   â  I wonâ  t sell  him at all â   said the father  â  my own flesh and blood is dearer to me  than all the silver and gold in the world.â   But Tom  hearing of the  bargain they wanted to make  crept up his fatherâ  s coat to his shoulder  and whispered in his ear  â  Take the money  father  and let them have me   Iâ  ll soon come back to you.â      So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a  large piece of gold  and they paid the price. â  Where would you like to  sit â   said one of them. â  Oh  put me on the rim of your hat  that will be  a nice gallery for me  I can walk about there and see the country as we  go along.â   So they did as he wished  and when Tom had taken leave of his  father they took him away with them.    They journeyed on till it began to be dusky  and then the little man  said  â  Let me get down  Iâ  m tired.â   So the man took off his hat  and  put him down on a clod of earth  in a ploughed field by the side of the  road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows  and at last slipped into  an old mouse hole. â  Good night  my masters â   said he  â  Iâ  m off  mind and  look sharp after me the next time.â   Then they ran at once to the place   and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse hole  but all in vain   Tom only crawled farther and farther in  and at last it became quite  dark  so that they were forced to go their way without their prize  as  sulky as could be.    When Tom found they were gone  he came out of his hiding place. â  What  dangerous walking it is â   said he  â  in this ploughed field  If I were to  fall from one of these great clods  I should undoubtedly break my neck.â    At last  by good luck  he found a large empty snail shell. â  This is  lucky â   said he  â  I can sleep here very wellâ    and in he crept.    Just as he was falling asleep  he heard two men passing by  chatting  together  and one said to the other  â  How can we rob that rich parsonâ  s  house of his silver and gold â   â  Iâ  ll tell you â   cried Tom. â  What noise  was that â   said the thief  frightened  â  Iâ  m sure I heard someone speak.â    They stood still listening  and Tom said  â  Take me with you  and Iâ  ll  soon show you how to get the parsonâ  s money.â   â  But where are you â   said  they. â  Look about on the ground â   answered he  â  and listen where the  sound comes from.â   At last the thieves found him out  and lifted him  up in their hands. â  You little urchin â   they said  â  what can you do for  us â   â  Why  I can get between the iron window bars of the parsonâ  s house   and throw you out whatever you want.â   â  Thatâ  s a good thought â   said the  thieves  â  come along  we shall see what you can do.â      When they came to the parsonâ  s house  Tom slipped through the  window bars into the room  and then called out as loud as he could bawl   â  Will you have all that is here â   At this the thieves were frightened   and said  â  Softly  softly  Speak low  that you may not awaken anybody.â    But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them  and bawled out again   â  How much will you have  Shall I throw it all out â   Now the cook lay in  the next room  and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and  listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened  and ran off a little  way  but at last they plucked up their hearts  and said  â  The little  urchin is only trying to make fools of us.â   So they came back and  whispered softly to him  saying  â  Now let us have no more of your  roguish jokes  but throw us out some of the money.â   Then Tom called out  as loud as he could  â  Very well  hold your hands  here it comes.â      The cook heard this quite plain  so she sprang out of bed  and ran to  open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails  and  the maid  having groped about and found nothing  went away for a light.  By the time she came back  Tom had slipped off into the barn  and when  she had looked about and searched every hole and corner  and found  nobody  she went to bed  thinking she must have been dreaming with her  eyes open.    The little man crawled about in the hay loft  and at last found a snug  place to finish his nightâ  s rest in  so he laid himself down  meaning  to sleep till daylight  and then find his way home to his father and  mother. But alas  how woefully he was undone  what crosses and sorrows  happen to us all in this world  The cook got up early  before daybreak   to feed the cows  and going straight to the hay loft  carried away  a large bundle of hay  with the little man in the middle of it  fast  asleep. He still  however  slept on  and did not awake till he found  himself in the mouth of the cow  for the cook had put the hay into the  cowâ  s rick  and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. â  Good  lack a day â   said he  â  how came I to tumble into the mill â   But he soon  found out where he really was  and was forced to have all his wits about  him  that he might not get between the cowâ  s teeth  and so be crushed to  death. At last down he went into her stomach. â  It is rather dark â   said  he  â  they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in  a  candle would be no bad thing.â      Though he made the best of his bad luck  he did not like his quarters at  all  and the worst of it was  that more and more hay was always coming  down  and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he  cried out as loud as he could  â  Donâ  t bring me any more hay  Donâ  t bring  me any more hay â      The maid happened to be just then milking the cow  and hearing someone  speak  but seeing nobody  and yet being quite sure it was the same voice  that she had heard in the night  she was so frightened that she fell off  her stool  and overset the milk pail. As soon as she could pick herself  up out of the dirt  she ran off as fast as she could to her master the  parson  and said  â  Sir  sir  the cow is talking â   But the parson  said  â  Woman  thou art surely mad â   However  he went with her into the  cow house  to try and see what was the matter.    Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold  when Tom called out  â  Donâ  t  bring me any more hay â   Then the parson himself was frightened  and  thinking the cow was surely bewitched  told his man to kill her on the  spot. So the cow was killed  and cut up  and the stomach  in which Tom  lay  was thrown out upon a dunghill.    Tom soon set himself to work to get out  which was not a very easy  task  but at last  just as he had made room to get his head out  fresh  ill luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out  and swallowed up the  whole stomach  with Tom in it  at one gulp  and ran away.    Tom  however  was still not disheartened  and thinking the wolf would  not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along  he called  out  â  My good friend  I can show you a famous treat.â   â  Whereâ  s that â    said the wolf. â  In such and such a house â   said Tom  describing his own  fatherâ  s house. â  You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and  then into the pantry  and there you will find cakes  ham  beef  cold  chicken  roast pig  apple dumplings  and everything that your heart can  wish.â      The wolf did not want to be asked twice  so that very night he went to  the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen  and then into  the pantry  and ate and drank there to his heartâ  s content. As soon as  he had had enough he wanted to get away  but he had eaten so much that  he could not go out by the same way he came in.    This was just what Tom had reckoned upon  and now he began to set up a  great shout  making all the noise he could. â  Will you be easy â   said the  wolf  â  youâ  ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.â    â  Whatâ  s that to me â   said the little man  â  you have had your frolic  now  Iâ  ve a mind to be merry myselfâ    and he began  singing and shouting as  loud as he could.    The woodman and his wife  being awakened by the noise  peeped through  a crack in the door  but when they saw a wolf was there  you may well  suppose that they were sadly frightened  and the woodman ran for his  axe  and gave his wife a scythe. â  Do you stay behind â   said the woodman   â  and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the  scythe.â   Tom heard all this  and cried out  â  Father  father  I am here   the wolf has swallowed me.â   And his father said  â  Heaven be praised  we  have found our dear child againâ    and he told his wife not to use the  scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow  and  struck the wolf on the head  and killed him on the spot  and when he was  dead they cut open his body  and set Tommy free. â  Ah â   said the father   â  what fears we have had for you â   â  Yes  father â   answered he  â  I have  travelled all over the world  I think  in one way or other  since we  parted  and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.â    â  Why  where have you been â   said his father. â  I have been in a  mouse hole  and in a snail shell  and down a cowâ  s throat  and in the  wolfâ  s belly  and yet here I am again  safe and sound.â      â  Well â   said they  â  you are come back  and we will not sell you again  for all the riches in the world.â      Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son  and gave him plenty  to eat and drink  for he was very hungry  and then they fetched new  clothes for him  for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.  So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother  in peace  for  though he had been so great a traveller  and had done and seen so many  fine things  and was fond enough of telling the whole story  he always  agreed that  after all  thereâ  s no place like HOME           RUMPELSTILTSKIN      By the side of a wood  in a country a long way off  ran a fine stream  of water  and upon the stream there stood a mill. The millerâ  s house was  close by  and the miller  you must know  had a very beautiful daughter.  She was  moreover  very shrewd and clever  and the miller was so proud  of her  that he one day told the king of the land  who used to come and  hunt in the wood  that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now  this king was very fond of money  and when he heard the millerâ  s boast  his greediness was raised  and he sent for the girl to be brought before  him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great  heap of straw  and gave her a spinning wheel  and said  â  All this must  be spun into gold before morning  as you love your life.â   It was in vain  that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father   for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold  the chamber  door was locked  and she was left alone.    She sat down in one corner of the room  and began to bewail her hard  fate  when on a sudden the door opened  and a droll looking little man  hobbled in  and said  â  Good morrow to you  my good lass  what are you  weeping for â   â  Alas â   said she  â  I must spin this straw into gold  and  I know not how.â   â  What will you give me â   said the hobgoblin  â  to do it  for you â   â  My necklace â   replied the maiden. He took her at her word   and sat himself down to the wheel  and whistled and sang      â  Round about  round about       Lo and behold     Reel away  reel away       Straw into gold â      And round about the wheel went merrily  the work was quickly done  and  the straw was all spun into gold.    When the king came and saw this  he was greatly astonished and pleased   but his heart grew still more greedy of gain  and he shut up the poor  millerâ  s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do   and sat down once more to weep  but the dwarf soon opened the door  and  said  â  What will you give me to do your task â   â  The ring on my finger â    said she. So her little friend took the ring  and began to work at the  wheel again  and whistled and sang      â  Round about  round about       Lo and behold     Reel away  reel away       Straw into gold â      till  long before morning  all was done again.    The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure   but still he had not enough  so he took the millerâ  s daughter to a yet  larger heap  and said  â  All this must be spun tonight  and if it is   you shall be my queen.â   As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in  and  said  â  What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time â    â  I have nothing left â   said she. â  Then say you will give me â   said  the little man  â  the first little child that you may have when you are  queen.â   â  That may never be â   thought the millerâ  s daughter  and as she  knew no other way to get her task done  she said she would do what he  asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song  and the manikin once  more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning  and  finding  all he wanted  was forced to keep his word  so he married the millerâ  s  daughter  and she really became queen.    At the birth of her first little child she was very glad  and forgot the  dwarf  and what she had said. But one day he came into her room  where  she was sitting playing with her baby  and put her in mind of it. Then  she grieved sorely at her misfortune  and said she would give him all  the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off  but in vain  till at  last her tears softened him  and he said  â  I will give you three daysâ    grace  and if during that time you tell me my name  you shall keep your  child.â      Now the queen lay awake all night  thinking of all the odd names that  she had ever heard  and she sent messengers all over the land to find  out new ones. The next day the little man came  and she began with  TIMOTHY  ICHABOD  BENJAMIN  JEREMIAH  and all the names she could  remember  but to all and each of them he said  â  Madam  that is not my  name.â      The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of   BANDY LEGS  HUNCHBACK  CROOK SHANKS  and so on  but the little gentleman  still said to every one of them  â  Madam  that is not my name.â      The third day one of the messengers came back  and said  â  I have  travelled two days without hearing of any other names  but yesterday  as  I was climbing a high hill  among the trees of the forest where the fox  and the hare bid each other good night  I saw a little hut  and before  the hut burnt a fire  and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was  dancing upon one leg  and singing      â  Merrily the feast Iâ  ll make.    Today Iâ  ll brew  tomorrow bake     Merrily Iâ  ll dance and sing     For next day will a stranger bring.    Little does my lady dream    Rumpelstiltskin is my name â      When the queen heard this she jumped for joy  and as soon as her little  friend came she sat down upon her throne  and called all her court round  to enjoy the fun  and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her  arms  as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began  to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child  to take home with  him to his hut in the woods  and he cried out  â  Now  lady  what is my  name â   â  Is it JOHN â   asked she. â  No  madam â   â  Is it TOM â   â  No  madam â    â  Is it JEMMY â   â  It is not.â   â  Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN â   said the  lady slyly. â  Some witch told you that   some witch told you that â   cried  the little man  and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the  floor  that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it  out.    Then he made the best of his way off  while the nurse laughed and the  baby crowed  and all the court jeered at him for having had so much  trouble for nothing  and said  â  We wish you a very good morning  and a  merry feast  Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN â            CLEVER GRETEL      There was once a cook named Gretel  who wore shoes with red heels  and  when she walked out with them on  she turned herself this way and that   was quite happy and thought  â  You certainly are a pretty girl â   And when  she came home she drank  in her gladness of heart  a draught of wine   and as wine excites a desire to eat  she tasted the best of whatever she  was cooking until she was satisfied  and said  â  The cook must know what  the food is like.â      It came to pass that the master one day said to her  â  Gretel  there is a  guest coming this evening  prepare me two fowls very daintily.â   â  I will  see to it  master â   answered Gretel. She killed two fowls  scalded them   plucked them  put them on the spit  and towards evening set them before  the fire  that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown  and were  nearly ready  but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out  to her master  â  If the guest does not come  I must take the fowls away  from the fire  but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten  the moment they are at their juiciest.â   The master said  â  I will run  myself  and fetch the guest.â   When the master had turned his back   Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side  and thought  â  Standing  so long by the fire there  makes one sweat and thirsty  who knows  when they will come  Meanwhile  I will run into the cellar  and take a  drink.â   She ran down  set a jug  said  â  God bless it for you  Gretel â    and took a good drink  and thought that wine should flow on  and should  not be interrupted  and took yet another hearty draught.    Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire  basted them   and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good   Gretel thought  â  Something might be wrong  it ought to be tasted â    She touched it with her finger  and said  â  Ah  how good fowls are  It  certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right  time â   She ran to the window  to see if the master was not coming with  his guest  but she saw no one  and went back to the fowls and thought   â  One of the wings is burning  I had better take it off and eat it.â    So she cut it off  ate it  and enjoyed it  and when she had done  she  thought  â  The other must go down too  or else master will observe that  something is missing.â   When the two wings were eaten  she went and  looked for her master  and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to  her  â  Who knows  They are perhaps not coming at all  and have turned in  somewhere.â   Then she said  â  Well  Gretel  enjoy yourself  one fowl has  been cut into  take another drink  and eat it up entirely  when it is  eaten you will have some peace  why should Godâ  s good gifts be spoilt â    So she ran into the cellar again  took an enormous drink and ate up the  one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down   and still her master did not come  Gretel looked at the other and said   â  What one is  the other should be likewise  the two go together  whatâ  s  right for the one is right for the other  I think if I were to take  another draught it would do me no harm.â   So she took another hearty  drink  and let the second chicken follow the first.    While she was making the most of it  her master came and cried  â  Hurry  up  Gretel  the guest is coming directly after me â   â  Yes  sir  I will  soon serve up â   answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that  the table was properly laid  and took the great knife  wherewith he was  going to carve the chickens  and sharpened it on the steps. Presently  the guest came  and knocked politely and courteously at the house door.  Gretel ran  and looked to see who was there  and when she saw the guest   she put her finger to her lips and said  â  Hush  hush  go away as quickly  as you can  if my master catches you it will be the worse for you  he  certainly did ask you to supper  but his intention is to cut off your  two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it â   The guest  heard the sharpening  and hurried down the steps again as fast as he  could. Gretel was not idle  she ran screaming to her master  and cried   â  You have invited a fine guest â   â  Why  Gretel  What do you mean by  that â   â  Yes â   said she  â  he has taken the chickens which I was just  going to serve up  off the dish  and has run away with them â   â  Thatâ  s a  nice trick â   said her master  and lamented the fine chickens. â  If he had  but left me one  so that something remained for me to eat.â   He called to  him to stop  but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him  with the knife still in his hand  crying  â  Just one  just one â   meaning  that the guest should leave him just one chicken  and not take both. The  guest  however  thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of  his ears  and ran as if fire were burning under him  in order to take  them both with him.          THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON      There was once a very old man  whose eyes had become dim  his ears dull  of hearing  his knees trembled  and when he sat at table he could hardly  hold the spoon  and spilt the broth upon the table cloth or let it run  out of his mouth. His son and his sonâ  s wife were disgusted at this  so  the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove   and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl  and not even enough  of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of  tears. Once  too  his trembling hands could not hold the bowl  and it  fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him  but he said  nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few  half pence  out of which he had to eat.    They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old  began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. â  What are  you doing there â   asked the father. â  I am making a little trough â    answered the child  â  for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.â      The man and his wife looked at each other for a while  and presently  began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table  and  henceforth always let him eat with them  and likewise said nothing if he  did spill a little of anything.          THE LITTLE PEASANT      There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich  peasants  and just one poor one  whom they called the little peasant. He  had not even so much as a cow  and still less money to buy one  and  yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her   â  Listen  I have a good idea  there is our gossip the carpenter  he shall  make us a wooden calf  and paint it brown  so that it looks like any  other  and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.â   the woman  also liked the idea  and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed  the calf  and painted it as it ought to be  and made it with its head  hanging down as if it were eating.    Next morning when the cows were being driven out  the little peasant  called the cow herd in and said  â  Look  I have a little calf there   but it is still small and has to be carried.â   The cow herd said  â  All  right â   and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture  and set  it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one  which was eating  and the cow herd said  â  It will soon run by itself   just look how it eats already â   At night when he was going to drive the  herd home again  he said to the calf  â  If you can stand there and eat  your fill  you can also go on your four legs  I donâ  t care to drag you  home again in my arms.â   But the little peasant stood at his door  and  waited for his little calf  and when the cow herd drove the cows through  the village  and the calf was missing  he inquired where it was. The  cow herd answered  â  It is still standing out there eating. It would not  stop and come with us.â   But the little peasant said  â  Oh  but I must  have my beast back again.â   Then they went back to the meadow together   but someone had stolen the calf  and it was gone. The cow herd said  â  It  must have run away.â   The peasant  however  said  â  Donâ  t tell me  that â   and led the cow herd before the mayor  who for his carelessness  condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.    And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had  so long wished  and they were heartily glad  but they had no food for  it  and could give it nothing to eat  so it soon had to be killed. They  salted the flesh  and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell  the skin there  so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On  the way he passed by a mill  and there sat a raven with broken wings   and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the  weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind  he could  go no farther  and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The  millerâ  s wife was alone in the house  and said to the peasant  â  Lay  yourself on the straw there â   and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.  The peasant ate it  and lay down with his skin beside him  and the woman  thought  â  He is tired and has gone to sleep.â   In the meantime came the  parson  the millerâ  s wife received him well  and said  â  My husband is  out  so we will have a feast.â   The peasant listened  and when he heard  them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make  shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four  different things  roast meat  salad  cakes  and wine.    Just as they were about to sit down and eat  there was a knocking  outside. The woman said  â  Oh  heavens  It is my husband â   she quickly  hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove  the wine under the pillow   the salad on the bed  the cakes under it  and the parson in the closet  on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband  and said  â  Thank  heaven  you are back again  There is such a storm  it looks as if the  world were coming to an end.â   The miller saw the peasant lying on the  straw  and asked  â  What is that fellow doing there â   â  Ah â   said the  wife  â  the poor knave came in the storm and rain  and begged for  shelter  so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese  and showed him where  the straw was.â   The man said  â  I have no objection  but be quick and get  me something to eat.â   The woman said  â  But I have nothing but bread and  cheese.â   â  I am contented with anything â   replied the husband  â  so far as  I am concerned  bread and cheese will do â   and looked at the peasant and  said  â  Come and eat some more with me.â   The peasant did not require to  be invited twice  but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin  in which the raven was  lying on the ground  and asked  â  What have you  there â   The peasant answered  â  I have a soothsayer inside it.â   â  Can  he foretell anything to me â   said the miller. â  Why not â   answered  the peasant  â  but he only says four things  and the fifth he keeps to  himself.â   The miller was curious  and said  â  Let him foretell something  for once.â   Then the peasant pinched the ravenâ  s head  so that he croaked  and made a noise like krr  krr. The miller said  â  What did he say â   The  peasant answered  â  In the first place  he says that there is some wine  hidden under the pillow.â   â  Bless me â   cried the miller  and went there  and found the wine. â  Now go on â   said he. The peasant made the raven  croak again  and said  â  In the second place  he says that there is some  roast meat in the tiled stove.â   â  Upon my word â   cried the miller  and  went thither  and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven  prophesy still more  and said  â  Thirdly  he says that there is some  salad on the bed.â   â  That would be a fine thing â   cried the miller  and  went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven  once more till he croaked  and said  â  Fourthly  he says that there  are some cakes under the bed.â   â  That would be a fine thing â   cried the  miller  and looked there  and found the cakes.    And now the two sat down to the table together  but the millerâ  s wife  was frightened to death  and went to bed and took all the keys with  her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth  but the little  peasant said  â  First  we will quickly eat the four things  for the fifth  is something bad.â   So they ate  and after that they bargained how much  the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy  until they agreed on  three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the ravenâ  s  head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked  â  What did he say â   The  peasant replied  â  He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in  the closet on the porch.â   The miller said  â  The Devil must go out â   and  opened the house door  then the woman was forced to give up the keys   and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he  could  and the miller said  â  It was true  I saw the black rascal with my  own eyes.â   The peasant  however  made off next morning by daybreak with  the three hundred talers.    At home the small peasant gradually launched out  he built a beautiful  house  and the peasants said  â  The small peasant has certainly been to  the place where golden snow falls  and people carry the gold home in  shovels.â   Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor  and  bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered  â  I sold my cowâ  s  skin in the town  for three hundred talers.â   When the peasants heard  that  they too wished to enjoy this great profit  and ran home  killed  all their cows  and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in  the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor  however  said  â  But my  servant must go first.â   When she came to the merchant in the town  he  did not give her more than two talers for a skin  and when the others  came  he did not give them so much  and said  â  What can I do with all  these skins â      Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus  outwitted them  wanted to take vengeance on him  and accused him of this  treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously  sentenced to death  and was to be rolled into the water  in a barrel  pierced full of holes. He was led forth  and a priest was brought who  was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to  a distance  and when the peasant looked at the priest  he recognized the  man who had been with the millerâ  s wife. He said to him  â  I set you free  from the closet  set me free from the barrel.â   At this same moment up  came  with a flock of sheep  the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had  long been wishing to be mayor  so he cried with all his might  â  No  I  will not do it  if the whole world insists on it  I will not do it â   The  shepherd hearing that  came up to him  and asked  â  What are you about   What is it that you will not do â   The peasant said  â  They want to make  me mayor  if I will but put myself in the barrel  but I will not do it.â    The shepherd said  â  If nothing more than that is needful in order to be  mayor  I would get into the barrel at once.â   The peasant said  â  If you  will get in  you will be mayor.â   The shepherd was willing  and got in   and the peasant shut the top down on him  then he took the shepherdâ  s  flock for himself  and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd   and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the  barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll  the shepherd  cried  â  I am quite willing to be mayor.â   They believed no otherwise than  that it was the peasant who was saying this  and answered  â  That is  what we intend  but first you shall look about you a little down below  there â   and they rolled the barrel down into the water.    After that the peasants went home  and as they were entering the  village  the small peasant also came quietly in  driving a flock of  sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished   and said  â  Peasant  from whence do you come  Have you come out of the  water â   â  Yes  truly â   replied the peasant  â  I sank deep  deep down   until at last I got to the bottom  I pushed the bottom out of the  barrel  and crept out  and there were pretty meadows on which a number  of lambs were feeding  and from thence I brought this flock away with  me.â   Said the peasants  â  Are there any more there â   â  Oh  yes â   said he   â  more than I could want.â   Then the peasants made up their minds that  they too would fetch some sheep for themselves  a flock apiece  but the  mayor said  â  I come first.â   So they went to the water together  and just  then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky  which  are called little lambs  and they were reflected in the water  whereupon  the peasants cried  â  We already see the sheep down below â   The mayor  pressed forward and said  â  I will go down first  and look about me  and  if things promise well Iâ  ll call you.â   So he jumped in  splash  went  the water  it sounded as if he were calling them  and the whole crowd  plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead  and  the small peasant  as sole heir  became a rich man.          FREDERICK AND CATHERINE      There was once a man called Frederick  he had a wife whose name was  Catherine  and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.  â  Kate  I am going to work in the fields  when I come back I shall be  hungry so let me have something nice cooked  and a good draught of ale.â    â  Very well â   said she  â  it shall all be ready.â   When dinner time drew  nigh  Catherine took a nice steak  which was all the meat she had  and  put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown  and to  crackle in the pan  and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it   then she said to herself  â  The steak is almost ready  I may as well go  to the cellar for the ale.â   So she left the pan on the fire and took a  large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran  into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her  head  â  The dog is not shut up  he may be running away with the steak   thatâ  s well thought of.â   So up she ran from the cellar  and sure enough  the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth  and was making off with  it.    Away ran Catherine  and away ran the dog across the field  but he ran  faster than she  and stuck close to the steak. â  Itâ  s all gone  and â  what  canâ  t be cured must be enduredâ   â   said Catherine. So she turned round   and as she had run a good way and was tired  she walked home leisurely  to cool herself.    Now all this time the ale was running too  for Catherine had not turned  the cock  and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till  the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had  happened. â  My stars â   said she  â  what shall I do to keep Frederick from  seeing all this slopping about â   So she thought a while  and at last  remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair   and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale  nicely. â  What a lucky thing â   said she  â  that we kept that meal  we have  now a good use for it.â   So away she went for it  but she managed to set  it down just upon the great jug full of beer  and upset it  and thus  all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. â  Ah   well â   said she  â  when one goes another may as well follow.â   Then she  strewed the meal all about the cellar  and was quite pleased with her  cleverness  and said  â  How very neat and clean it looks â      At noon Frederick came home. â  Now  wife â   cried he  â  what have you for  dinner â   â  O Frederick â   answered she  â  I was cooking you a steak  but  while I went down to draw the ale  the dog ran away with it  and while  I ran after him  the ale ran out  and when I went to dry up the ale  with the sack of meal that we got at the fair  I upset the jug  but the  cellar is now quite dry  and looks so clean â   â  Kate  Kate â   said he   â  how could you do all this â   Why did you leave the steak to fry  and the  ale to run  and then spoil all the meal â   â  Why  Frederick â   said she  â  I  did not know I was doing wrong  you should have told me before.â      The husband thought to himself  â  If my wife manages matters thus  I must  look sharp myself.â   Now he had a good deal of gold in the house  so he  said to Catherine  â  What pretty yellow buttons these are  I shall put  them into a box and bury them in the garden  but take care that you  never go near or meddle with them.â   â  No  Frederick â   said she  â  that  I never will.â   As soon as he was gone  there came by some pedlars with  earthenware plates and dishes  and they asked her whether she would buy.  â  Oh dear me  I should like to buy very much  but I have no money  if  you had any use for yellow buttons  I might deal with you.â   â  Yellow  buttons â   said they  â  let us have a look at them.â   â  Go into the garden  and dig where I tell you  and you will find the yellow buttons  I dare  not go myself.â   So the rogues went  and when they found what these  yellow buttons were  they took them all away  and left her plenty of  plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show   and when Frederick came back  he cried out  â  Kate  what have you been  doing â   â  See â   said she  â  I have bought all these with your yellow  buttons  but I did not touch them myself  the pedlars went themselves  and dug them up.â   â  Wife  wife â   said Frederick  â  what a pretty piece of  work you have made  those yellow buttons were all my money  how came you  to do such a thing â   â  Why â   answered she  â  I did not know there was any  harm in it  you should have told me.â      Catherine stood musing for a while  and at last said to her husband   â  Hark ye  Frederick  we will soon get the gold back  let us run after  the thieves.â   â  Well  we will try â   answered he  â  but take some butter  and cheese with you  that we may have something to eat by the way.â    â  Very well â   said she  and they set out  and as Frederick walked the  fastest  he left his wife some way behind. â  It does not matter â   thought  she  â  when we turn back  I shall be so much nearer home than he.â      Presently she came to the top of a hill  down the side of which there  was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees  on each side as they passed. â  Ah  see now â   said she  â  how they have  bruised and wounded those poor trees  they will never get well.â   So she  took pity on them  and made use of the butter to grease them all  so  that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this  kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket  and rolled down  the hill. Catherine looked  but could not see where it had gone  so she  said  â  Well  I suppose the other will go the same way and find you  he  has younger legs than I have.â   Then she rolled the other cheese after  it  and away it went  nobody knows where  down the hill. But she said  she supposed that they knew the road  and would follow her  and she  could not stay there all day waiting for them.    At last she overtook Frederick  who desired her to give him something to  eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. â  Where are the butter and cheese â    said he. â  Oh â   answered she  â  I used the butter to grease those poor  trees that the wheels chafed so  and one of the cheeses ran away so I  sent the other after it to find it  and I suppose they are both on  the road together somewhere.â   â  What a goose you are to do such silly  things â   said the husband. â  How can you say so â   said she  â  I am sure  you never told me not.â      They ate the dry bread together  and Frederick said  â  Kate  I hope you  locked the door safe when you came away.â   â  No â   answered she  â  you did  not tell me.â   â  Then go home  and do it now before we go any farther â    said Frederick  â  and bring with you something to eat.â      Catherine did as he told her  and thought to herself by the way   â  Frederick wants something to eat  but I donâ  t think he is very fond of  butter and cheese  Iâ  ll bring him a bag of fine nuts  and the vinegar   for I have often seen him take some.â      When she reached home  she bolted the back door  but the front door she  took off the hinges  and said  â  Frederick told me to lock the door  but  surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.â   So she took  her time by the way  and when she overtook her husband she cried  out  â  There  Frederick  there is the door itself  you may watch it as  carefully as you please.â   â  Alas  alas â   said he  â  what a clever wife I  have  I sent you to make the house fast  and you take the door away  so  that everybody may go in and out as they please  however  as you have  brought the door  you shall carry it about with you for your pains.â    â  Very well â   answered she  â  Iâ  ll carry the door  but Iâ  ll not carry the  nuts and vinegar bottle also  that would be too much of a load  so if  you please  Iâ  ll fasten them to the door.â      Frederick of course made no objection to that plan  and they set off  into the wood to look for the thieves  but they could not find them  and  when it grew dark  they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.  Scarcely were they up  than who should come by but the very rogues they  were looking for. They were in truth great rascals  and belonged to that  class of people who find things before they are lost  they were tired   so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and  Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side  and picked up  some stones. Then he climbed up again  and tried to hit the thieves on  the head with them  but they only said  â  It must be near morning  for  the wind shakes the fir apples down.â      Catherine  who had the door on her shoulder  began to be very tired   but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy  so she said  softly  â  Frederick  I must let the nuts go.â   â  No â   answered he  â  not  now  they will discover us.â   â  I canâ  t help that  they must go.â   â  Well   then  make haste and throw them down  if you will.â   Then away rattled  the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried  â  Bless me   it is hailing.â      A little while after  Catherine thought the door was still very heavy   so she whispered to Frederick  â  I must throw the vinegar down.â   â  Pray  donâ  t â   answered he  â  it will discover us.â   â  I canâ  t help that â   said  she  â  go it must.â   So she poured all the vinegar down  and the thieves  said  â  What a heavy dew there is â      At last it popped into Catherineâ  s head that it was the door itself that  was so heavy all the time  so she whispered  â  Frederick  I must throw  the door down soon.â   But he begged and prayed her not to do so  for he  was sure it would betray them. â  Here goes  however â   said she  and down  went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves  that they cried  out â  Murder â   and not knowing what was coming  ran away as fast as they  could  and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down   there they found all their money safe and sound.          SWEETHEART ROLAND      There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two  daughters  one ugly and wicked  and this one she loved because she was  her own daughter  and one beautiful and good  and this one she hated   because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty  apron  which the other fancied so much that she became envious  and  told her mother that she must and would have that apron. â  Be quiet  my  child â   said the old woman  â  and you shall have it. Your stepsister has  long deserved death  tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her  head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed  and  push her well to the front.â   It would have been all over with the poor  girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner  and heard  everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors  and when bedtime  had come  the witchâ  s daughter got into bed first  so as to lie at the  far side  but when she was asleep  the other pushed her gently to the  front  and took for herself the place at the back  close by the wall. In  the night  the old woman came creeping in  she held an axe in her right  hand  and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside   and then she grasped the axe with both hands  and cut her own childâ  s  head off.    When she had gone away  the girl got up and went to her sweetheart  who  was called Roland  and knocked at his door. When he came out  she said  to him  â  Listen  dearest Roland  we must fly in all haste  my stepmother  wanted to kill me  but has struck her own child. When daylight comes   and she sees what she has done  we shall be lost.â   â  But â   said Roland   â  I counsel you first to take away her magic wand  or we cannot escape  if she pursues us.â   The maiden fetched the magic wand  and she took the  dead girlâ  s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground  one in  front of the bed  one in the kitchen  and one on the stairs. Then she  hurried away with her lover.    When the old witch got up next morning  she called her daughter  and  wanted to give her the apron  but she did not come. Then the witch  cried  â  Where are you â   â  Here  on the stairs  I am sweeping â   answered  the first drop of blood. The old woman went out  but saw no one on the  stairs  and cried again  â  Where are you â   â  Here in the kitchen  I am  warming myself â   cried the second drop of blood. She went into the  kitchen  but found no one. Then she cried again  â  Where are you â   â  Ah   here in the bed  I am sleeping â   cried the third drop of blood. She went  into the room to the bed. What did she see there  Her own child   whose head she had cut off  bathed in her blood. The witch fell into  a passion  sprang to the window  and as she could look forth quite far  into the world  she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her  sweetheart Roland. â  That shall not help you â   cried she  â  even if you  have got a long way off  you shall still not escape me.â   She put on her  many league boots  in which she covered an hourâ  s walk at every step   and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl  however  when  she saw the old woman striding towards her  changed  with her magic  wand  her sweetheart Roland into a lake  and herself into a duck  swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore   threw breadcrumbs in  and went to endless trouble to entice the duck   but the duck did not let herself be enticed  and the old woman had to  go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart  Roland resumed their natural shapes again  and they walked on the whole  night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful  flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge  and her sweetheart  Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up  towards them  and said to the musician  â  Dear musician  may I pluck that  beautiful flower for myself â   â  Oh  yes â   he replied  â  I will play to  you while you do it.â   As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was  just going to pluck the flower  knowing perfectly well who the flower  was  he began to play  and whether she would or not  she was forced  to dance  for it was a magical dance. The faster he played  the more  violent springs was she forced to make  and the thorns tore her clothes  from her body  and pricked her and wounded her till she bled  and as he  did not stop  she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.    As they were now set free  Roland said  â  Now I will go to my father and  arrange for the wedding.â   â  Then in the meantime I will stay here and  wait for you â   said the girl  â  and that no one may recognize me  I will  change myself into a red stone landmark.â   Then Roland went away  and the  girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.  But when Roland got home  he fell into the snares of another  who so  fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a  long time  but at length  as he did not return at all  she was sad  and  changed herself into a flower  and thought  â  Someone will surely come  this way  and trample me down.â      It befell  however  that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw  the flower  and as it was so pretty  plucked it  took it with him  and  laid it away in his chest. From that time forth  strange things happened  in the shepherdâ  s house. When he arose in the morning  all the work was  already done  the room was swept  the table and benches cleaned  the  fire in the hearth was lighted  and the water was fetched  and at noon   when he came home  the table was laid  and a good dinner served. He  could not conceive how this came to pass  for he never saw a human being  in his house  and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was  certainly pleased with this good attendance  but still at last he was so  afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise  woman said  â  There is some enchantment behind it  listen very early some  morning if anything is moving in the room  and if you see anything  no  matter what it is  throw a white cloth over it  and then the magic will  be stopped.â      The shepherd did as she bade him  and next morning just as day dawned   he saw the chest open  and the flower come out. Swiftly he  sprang towards it  and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the  transformation came to an end  and a beautiful girl stood before him   who admitted to him that she had been the flower  and that up to this  time she had attended to his house keeping. She told him her story   and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him  but she  answered  â  No â   for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart  Roland  although he had deserted her. Nevertheless  she promised not to  go away  but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.    And now the time drew near when Rolandâ  s wedding was to be celebrated   and then  according to an old custom in the country  it was announced  that all the girls were to be present at it  and sing in honour of the  bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this  she grew so sad  that she thought her heart would break  and she would not go thither   but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing   she stepped back  until at last she was the only one left  and then she  could not refuse. But when she began her song  and it reached Rolandâ  s  ears  he sprang up and cried  â  I know the voice  that is the true  bride  I will have no other â   Everything he had forgotten  and which had  vanished from his mind  had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then  the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland  and  grief came to an end and joy began.          SNOWDROP      It was the middle of winter  when the broad flakes of snow were falling  around  that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working  at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony  and  as she sat looking out upon the snow  she pricked her finger  and three  drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red  drops that sprinkled the white snow  and said  â  Would that my little  daughter may be as white as that snow  as red as that blood  and as  black as this ebony windowframe â   And so the little girl really did grow  up  her skin was as white as snow  her cheeks as rosy as the blood  and  her hair as black as ebony  and she was called Snowdrop.    But this queen died  and the king soon married another wife  who became  queen  and was very beautiful  but so vain that she could not bear  to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy  looking glass  to which she used to go  and then she would gaze upon  herself in it  and say      â  Tell me  glass  tell me true     Of all the ladies in the land     Who is fairest  tell me  who â      And the glass had always answered      â  Thou  queen  art the fairest in all the land.â      But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful  and when she was seven years  old she was as bright as the day  and fairer than the queen herself.  Then the glass one day answered the queen  when she went to look in it  as usual      â  Thou  queen  art fair  and beauteous to see     But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee â      When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy  and called to  one of her servants  and said  â  Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood   that I may never see her any more.â   Then the servant led her away  but  his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life  and he  said  â  I will not hurt you  thou pretty child.â   So he left her by  herself  and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would  tear her in pieces  he felt as if a great weight were taken off his  heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to  her fate  with the chance of someone finding and saving her.    Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear  and  the wild beasts roared about her  but none did her any harm. In the  evening she came to a cottage among the hills  and went in to rest  for  her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and  neat in the cottage  on the table was spread a white cloth  and there  were seven little plates  seven little loaves  and seven little glasses  with wine in them  and seven knives and forks laid in order  and by  the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry  she picked  a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each  glass  and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she  tried all the little beds  but one was too long  and another was too  short  till at last the seventh suited her  and there she laid herself  down and went to sleep.    By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little  dwarfs  that lived among the mountains  and dug and searched for gold.  They lighted up their seven lamps  and saw at once that all was not  right. The first said  â  Who has been sitting on my stool â   The second   â  Who has been eating off my plate â   The third  â  Who has been picking my  bread â   The fourth  â  Who has been meddling with my spoon â   The fifth   â  Who has been handling my fork â   The sixth  â  Who has been cutting with  my knife â   The seventh  â  Who has been drinking my wine â   Then the first  looked round and said  â  Who has been lying on my bed â   And the rest came  running to him  and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his  bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop  and called all his brethren to come  and see her  and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought  their lamps to look at her  and said  â  Good heavens  what a lovely child  she is â   And they were very glad to see her  and took care not to wake  her  and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs  in turn  till the night was gone.    In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story  and they pitied her   and said if she would keep all things in order  and cook and wash and  knit and spin for them  she might stay where she was  and they would  take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work   seeking for gold and silver in the mountains  but Snowdrop was left at  home  and they warned her  and said  â  The queen will soon find out where  you are  so take care and let no one in.â      But the queen  now that she thought Snowdrop was dead  believed that she  must be the handsomest lady in the land  and she went to her glass and  said      â  Tell me  glass  tell me true     Of all the ladies in the land     Who is fairest  tell me  who â      And the glass answered      â  Thou  queen  art the fairest in all this land     But over the hills  in the greenwood shade     Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made     There Snowdrop is hiding her head  and she    Is lovelier far  O queen  than thee.â      Then the queen was very much frightened  for she knew that the glass  always spoke the truth  and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.  And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful  than she was  so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar  and went  her way over the hills  to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she  knocked at the door  and cried  â  Fine wares to sell â   Snowdrop looked  out at the window  and said  â  Good day  good woman  what have you to  sell â   â  Good wares  fine wares â   said she  â  laces and bobbins of all  colours.â   â  I will let the old lady in  she seems to be a very good  sort of body â   thought Snowdrop  as she ran down and unbolted the door.  â  Bless me â   said the old woman  â  how badly your stays are laced  Let me  lace them up with one of my nice new laces.â   Snowdrop did not dream of  any mischief  so she stood before the old woman  but she set to work  so nimbly  and pulled the lace so tight  that Snowdropâ  s breath was  stopped  and she fell down as if she were dead. â  Thereâ  s an end to all  thy beauty â   said the spiteful queen  and went away home.    In the evening the seven dwarfs came home  and I need not say how  grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the  ground  as if she was quite dead. However  they lifted her up  and when  they found what ailed her  they cut the lace  and in a little time she  began to breathe  and very soon came to life again. Then they said  â  The  old woman was the queen herself  take care another time  and let no one  in when we are away.â      When the queen got home  she went straight to her glass  and spoke to it  as before  but to her great grief it still said      â  Thou  queen  art the fairest in all this land     But over the hills  in the greenwood shade     Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made     There Snowdrop is hiding her head  and she    Is lovelier far  O queen  than thee.â      Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice  to see that  Snowdrop still lived  and she dressed herself up again  but in quite  another dress from the one she wore before  and took with her a poisoned  comb. When she reached the dwarfsâ   cottage  she knocked at the door  and  cried  â  Fine wares to sell â   But Snowdrop said  â  I dare not let anyone  in.â   Then the queen said  â  Only look at my beautiful combs â   and gave  her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty  that she took it up and  put it into her hair to try it  but the moment it touched her head   the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. â  There you may  lie â   said the queen  and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs  came in very early that evening  and when they saw Snowdrop lying on  the ground  they thought what had happened  and soon found the poisoned  comb. And when they took it away she got well  and told them all that  had passed  and they warned her once more not to open the door to  anyone.    Meantime the queen went home to her glass  and shook with rage when she  read the very same answer as before  and she said  â  Snowdrop shall die   if it cost me my life.â   So she went by herself into her chamber  and got  ready a poisoned apple  the outside looked very rosy and tempting  but  whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a  peasantâ  s wife  and travelled over the hills to the dwarfsâ   cottage   and knocked at the door  but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and  said  â  I dare not let anyone in  for the dwarfs have told me not.â   â  Do  as you please â   said the old woman  â  but at any rate take this pretty  apple  I will give it you.â   â  No â   said Snowdrop  â  I dare not take it.â    â  You silly girl â   answered the other  â  what are you afraid of  Do you  think it is poisoned  Come  do you eat one part  and I will eat the  other.â   Now the apple was so made up that one side was good  though the  other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste  for  the apple looked so very nice  and when she saw the old woman eat  she  could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth   when she fell down dead upon the ground. â  This time nothing will save  thee â   said the queen  and she went home to her glass  and at last it  said      â  Thou  queen  art the fairest of all the fair.â      And then her wicked heart was glad  and as happy as such a heart could  be.    When evening came  and the dwarfs had gone home  they found Snowdrop  lying on the ground  no breath came from her lips  and they were afraid  that she was quite dead. They lifted her up  and combed her hair  and  washed her face with wine and water  but all was in vain  for the little  girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier  and all seven  watched and bewailed her three whole days  and then they thought they  would bury her  but her cheeks were still rosy  and her face looked just  as it did while she was alive  so they said  â  We will never bury her in  the cold ground.â   And they made a coffin of glass  so that they might  still look at her  and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name  was  and that she was a kingâ  s daughter. And the coffin was set among  the hills  and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the  birds of the air came too  and bemoaned Snowdrop  and first of all came  an owl  and then a raven  and at last a dove  and sat by her side.    And thus Snowdrop lay for a long  long time  and still only looked as  though she was asleep  for she was even now as white as snow  and as red  as blood  and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the  dwarfsâ   house  and he saw Snowdrop  and read what was written in golden  letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money  and prayed and besought them  to let him take her away  but they said  â  We will not part with her for  all the gold in the world.â   At last  however  they had pity on him  and  gave him the coffin  but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home  with him  the piece of apple fell from between her lips  and Snowdrop  awoke  and said  â  Where am I â   And the prince said  â  Thou art quite safe  with me.â      Then he told her all that had happened  and said  â  I love you far better  than all the world  so come with me to my fatherâ  s palace  and you shall  be my wife.â   And Snowdrop consented  and went home with the prince   and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their  wedding.    To the feast was asked  among the rest  Snowdropâ  s old enemy the queen   and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes  she looked in the  glass and said      â  Tell me  glass  tell me true     Of all the ladies in the land     Who is fairest  tell me  who â      And the glass answered      â  Thou  lady  art loveliest here  I ween     But lovelier far is the new made queen.â      When she heard this she started with rage  but her envy and curiosity  were so great  that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And  when she got there  and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop  who  as  she thought  had been dead a long while  she choked with rage  and fell  down and died  but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily  over that land many  many years  and sometimes they went up into the  mountains  and paid a visit to the little dwarfs  who had been so kind  to Snowdrop in her time of need.          THE PINK      There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.  Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to  bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her  and said  â  Be at rest  you shall have a son with the power of wishing   so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for  that shall he have.â   Then  she went to the king  and told him the joyful tidings  and when the time  was come she gave birth to a son  and the king was filled with gladness.    Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild  beasts were kept  and washed herself there in a clear stream. It  happened once when the child was a little older  that it was lying in  her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook  who knew that the  child had the power of wishing  and stole it away  and he took a hen   and cut it in pieces  and dropped some of its blood on the queenâ  s apron  and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place   where a nurse was obliged to suckle it  and he ran to the king and  accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by  the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron  he believed  this  fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built   in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into  it  and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat  or drink  and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the  shape of white doves  which flew to her twice a day  and carried her  food until the seven years were over.    The cook  however  thought to himself  â  If the child has the power of  wishing  and I am here  he might very easily get me into trouble.â   So  he left the palace and went to the boy  who was already big enough to  speak  and said to him  â  Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with  a garden  and all else that pertains to it.â   Scarcely were the words out  of the boyâ  s mouth  when everything was there that he had wished for.  After a while the cook said to him  â  It is not well for you to be so  alone  wish for a pretty girl as a companion.â   Then the kingâ  s son  wished for one  and she immediately stood before him  and was more  beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played  together  and loved each other with all their hearts  and the old cook  went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him  however   that the kingâ  s son might some day wish to be with his father  and thus  bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside   and said  â  Tonight when the boy is asleep  go to his bed and plunge this  knife into his heart  and bring me his heart and tongue  and if you do  not do it  you shall lose your life.â   Thereupon he went away  and when  he returned next day she had not done it  and said  â  Why should I shed  the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone â   The cook once  more said  â  If you do not do it  it shall cost you your own life.â   When  he had gone away  she had a little hind brought to her  and ordered her  to be killed  and took her heart and tongue  and laid them on a plate   and when she saw the old man coming  she said to the boy  â  Lie down in  your bed  and draw the clothes over you.â   Then the wicked wretch came in  and said  â  Where are the boyâ  s heart and tongue â   The girl reached the  plate to him  but the kingâ  s son threw off the quilt  and said  â  You old  sinner  why did you want to kill me  Now will I pronounce thy sentence.  You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck   and shall eat burning coals  till the flames burst forth from your  throat.â   And when he had spoken these words  the old man was changed  into a poodle dog  and had a gold collar round his neck  and the cooks  were ordered to bring up some live coals  and these he ate  until the  flames broke forth from his throat. The kingâ  s son remained there a  short while longer  and he thought of his mother  and wondered if she  were still alive. At length he said to the maiden  â  I will go home to my  own country  if you will go with me  I will provide for you.â   â  Ah â    she replied  â  the way is so long  and what shall I do in a strange land  where I am unknown â   As she did not seem quite willing  and as they  could not be parted from each other  he wished that she might be changed  into a beautiful pink  and took her with him. Then he went away to his  own country  and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower  in which his mother was confined  and as it was so high  he wished for  a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and  looked inside  and cried  â  Beloved mother  Lady Queen  are you still  alive  or are you dead â   She answered  â  I have just eaten  and am still  satisfied â   for she thought the angels were there. Said he  â  I am your  dear son  whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms   but I am alive still  and will soon set you free.â   Then he descended  again  and went to his father  and caused himself to be announced as a  strange huntsman  and asked if he could offer him service. The king said  yes  if he was skilful and could get game for him  he should come to  him  but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the  district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game  for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all  the huntsmen together  and bade them go out into the forest with him.  And he went with them and made them form a great circle  open at one end  where he stationed himself  and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more  came running inside the circle at once  and the huntsmen shot them.  Then they were all placed on sixty country carts  and driven home to the  king  and for once he was able to deck his table with game  after having  had none at all for years.    Now the king felt great joy at this  and commanded that his entire  household should eat with him next day  and made a great feast. When  they were all assembled together  he said to the huntsman  â  As you are  so clever  you shall sit by me.â   He replied  â  Lord King  your majesty  must excuse me  I am a poor huntsman.â   But the king insisted on it   and said  â  You shall sit by me â   until he did it. Whilst he was sitting  there  he thought of his dearest mother  and wished that one of the  kingâ  s principal servants would begin to speak of her  and would ask how  it was faring with the queen in the tower  and if she were alive still   or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began   and said  â  Your majesty  we live joyously here  but how is the queen  living in the tower  Is she still alive  or has she died â   But the king  replied  â  She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts  I will  not have her named.â   Then the huntsman arose and said  â  Gracious lord  father she is alive still  and I am her son  and I was not carried away  by wild beasts  but by that wretch the old cook  who tore me from her  arms when she was asleep  and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a  chicken.â   Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar  and said   â  That is the wretch â   and caused live coals to be brought  and these the  dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all  until flames burst  forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would  like to see the dog in his true shape  and wished him back into the form  of the cook  in which he stood immediately  with his white apron   and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion   and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman  spoke further and said  â  Father  will you see the maiden who brought me  up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me  but did not do it   though her own life depended on it â   The king replied  â  Yes  I would  like to see her.â   The son said  â  Most gracious father  I will show her  to you in the form of a beautiful flower â   and he thrust his hand into  his pocket and brought forth the pink  and placed it on the royal table   and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.  Then the son said  â  Now will I show her to you in her own form â   and  wished that she might become a maiden  and she stood there looking so  beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.    And the king sent two waiting maids and two attendants into the tower   to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was  led in she ate nothing  and said  â  The gracious and merciful God who has  supported me in the tower  will soon set me free.â   She lived three days  more  and then died happily  and when she was buried  the two white  doves which had brought her food to the tower  and were angels of  heaven  followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged  king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces  but grief consumed the  kingâ  s own heart  and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden  whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket  and whether they  are still alive or not  is known to God.          CLEVER ELSIE      There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And  when she had grown up her father said  â  We will get her married.â   â  Yes â    said the mother  â  if only someone would come who would have her.â   At  length a man came from a distance and wooed her  who was called Hans   but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. â  Oh â   said  the father  â  she has plenty of good senseâ    and the mother said  â  Oh   she can see the wind coming up the street  and hear the flies coughing.â    â  Well â   said Hans  â  if she is not really smart  I wonâ  t have her.â   When  they were sitting at dinner and had eaten  the mother said  â  Elsie  go  into the cellar and fetch some beer.â   Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher  from the wall  went into the cellar  and tapped the lid briskly as she  went  so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she  fetched herself a chair  and set it before the barrel so that she had  no need to stoop  and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected  injury. Then she placed the can before her  and turned the tap  and  while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle  but  looked up at the wall  and after much peering here and there  saw a  pick axe exactly above her  which the masons had accidentally left  there.    Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said  â  If I get Hans  and we have  a child  and he grows big  and we send him into the cellar here to draw  beer  then the pick axe will fall on his head and kill him.â   Then she  sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body  over the  misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink   but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant   â  Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.â   The maid went and  found her sitting in front of the barrel  screaming loudly. â  Elsie why  do you weep â   asked the maid. â  Ah â   she answered  â  have I not reason to  weep  If I get Hans  and we have a child  and he grows big  and has to  draw beer here  the pick axe will perhaps fall on his head  and kill  him.â   Then said the maid  â  What a clever Elsie we have â   and sat down  beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while   as the maid did not come back  and those upstairs were thirsty for the  beer  the man said to the boy  â  Just go down into the cellar and see  where Elsie and the girl are.â   The boy went down  and there sat Clever  Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked  â  Why are you  weeping â   â  Ah â   said Elsie  â  have I not reason to weep  If I get Hans   and we have a child  and he grows big  and has to draw beer here  the  pick axe will fall on his head and kill him.â   Then said the boy  â  What  a clever Elsie we have â   and sat down by her  and likewise began to  howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy  but as he still did not  return  the man said to the woman  â  Just go down into the cellar and see  where Elsie is â   The woman went down  and found all three in the midst  of their lamentations  and inquired what was the cause  then Elsie told  her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick axe  when it  grew big and had to draw beer  and the pick axe fell down. Then said the  mother likewise  â  What a clever Elsie we have â   and sat down and wept  with them. The man upstairs waited a short time  but as his wife did not  come back and his thirst grew ever greater  he said  â  I must go into the  cellar myself and see where Elsie is.â   But when he got into the cellar   and they were all sitting together crying  and he heard the reason  and  that Elsieâ  s child was the cause  and the Elsie might perhaps bring one  into the world some day  and that he might be killed by the pick axe  if  he should happen to be sitting beneath it  drawing beer just at the very  time when it fell down  he cried  â  Oh  what a clever Elsie â   and sat  down  and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone  for a long time  then as no one would come back he thought  â  They must be  waiting for me below  I too must go there and see what they are about.â    When he got down  the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting  quite piteously  each out doing the other. â  What misfortune has happened  then â   asked he. â  Ah  dear Hans â   said Elsie  â  if we marry each other  and have a child  and he is big  and we perhaps send him here to draw  something to drink  then the pick axe which has been left up there might  dash his brains out if it were to fall down  so have we not reason to  weep â   â  Come â   said Hans  â  more understanding than that is not needed  for my household  as you are such a clever Elsie  I will have you â   and  seized her hand  took her upstairs with him  and married her.    After Hans had had her some time  he said  â  Wife  I am going out to work  and earn some money for us  go into the field and cut the corn that we  may have some bread.â   â  Yes  dear Hans  I will do that.â   After Hans had  gone away  she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field  with her. When she came to the field she said to herself  â  What shall I  do  shall I cut first  or shall I eat first  Oh  I will eat first.â   Then  she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied  she once  more said  â  What shall I do  Shall I cut first  or shall I sleep first   I will sleep first.â   Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.  Hans had been at home for a long time  but Elsie did not come  then said  he  â  What a clever Elsie I have  she is so industrious that she does not  even come home to eat.â   But when evening came and she still stayed away   Hans went out to see what she had cut  but nothing was cut  and she  was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought  a fowlerâ  s net with little bells and hung it round about her  and she  still went on sleeping. Then he ran home  shut the house door  and sat  down in his chair and worked. At length  when it was quite dark  Clever  Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about  her  and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was  alarmed  and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or  not  and said  â  Is it I  or is it not I â   But she knew not what answer  to make to this  and stood for a time in doubt  at length she thought   â  I will go home and ask if it be I  or if it be not I  they will be sure  to know.â   She ran to the door of her own house  but it was shut  then  she knocked at the window and cried  â  Hans  is Elsie within â   â  Yes â    answered Hans  â  she is within.â   Hereupon she was terrified  and said   â  Ah  heavens  Then it is not I â   and went to another door  but when the  people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it  and she  could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village  and no one has  seen her since.          THE MISER IN THE BUSH      A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant  who had worked hard for  him three years  without having been paid any wages. At last it came  into the manâ  s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer   so he went to his master  and said  â  I have worked hard for you a long  time  I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my  trouble.â   The farmer was a sad miser  and knew that his man was very  simple hearted  so he took out threepence  and gave him for every yearâ  s  service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to  have  and said to himself  â  Why should I work hard  and live here on bad  fare any longer  I can now travel into the wide world  and make myself  merry.â   With that he put his money into his purse  and set out  roaming  over hill and valley.    As he jogged along over the fields  singing and dancing  a little dwarf  met him  and asked him what made him so merry. â  Why  what should make  me down hearted â   said he  â  I am sound in health and rich in purse  what  should I care for  I have saved up my three yearsâ   earnings and have it  all safe in my pocket.â   â  How much may it come to â   said the little man.  â  Full threepence â   replied the countryman. â  I wish you would give them  to me â   said the other  â  I am very poor.â   Then the man pitied him  and  gave him all he had  and the little dwarf said in return  â  As you have  such a kind honest heart  I will grant you three wishes  one for every  penny  so choose whatever you like.â   Then the countryman rejoiced at  his good luck  and said  â  I like many things better than money  first  I  will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at  secondly   a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it  and  thirdly  I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.â   The dwarf  said he should have his three wishes  so he gave him the bow and fiddle   and went his way.    Our honest friend journeyed on his way too  and if he was merry before   he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old  miser  close by them stood a tree  and on the topmost twig sat a thrush  singing away most joyfully. â  Oh  what a pretty bird â   said the miser  â  I  would give a great deal of money to have such a one.â   â  If thatâ  s all â    said the countryman  â  I will soon bring it down.â   Then he took up his  bow  and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.  The miser crept into the bush to find it  but directly he had got into  the middle  his companion took up his fiddle and played away  and the  miser began to dance and spring about  capering higher and higher in  the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung  in rags about him  and he himself was all scratched and wounded  so that  the blood ran down. â  Oh  for heavenâ  s sake â   cried the miser  â  Master   master  pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this â    â  Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough â   said the other  â  thou  art only meeting thy rewardâ    so he played up another tune. Then the  miser began to beg and promise  and offered money for his liberty  but  he did not come up to the musicianâ  s price for some time  and he danced  him along brisker and brisker  and the miser bid higher and higher  till  at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse   and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman  saw so much money  he said  â  I will agree to your proposal.â   So he took  the purse  put up his fiddle  and travelled on very pleased with his  bargain.    Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half naked and in a piteous  plight  and began to ponder how he should take his revenge  and serve  his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge  and  complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money  and beaten him  into the bargain  and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his  back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his  officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him  and he  was soon caught and brought up to be tried.    The miser began to tell his tale  and said he had been robbed of  his money. â  No  you gave it me for playing a tune to you.â   said the  countryman  but the judge told him that was not likely  and cut the  matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.    So away he was taken  but as he stood on the steps he said  â  My Lord  Judge  grant me one last request.â   â  Anything but thy life â   replied the  other. â  No â   said he  â  I do not ask my life  only to let me play upon  my fiddle for the last time.â   The miser cried out  â  Oh  no  no  for  heavenâ  s sake donâ  t listen to him  donâ  t listen to him â   But the judge  said  â  It is only this once  he will soon have done.â   The fact was  he  could not refuse the request  on account of the dwarfâ  s third gift.    Then the miser said  â  Bind me fast  bind me fast  for pityâ  s sake.â   But  the countryman seized his fiddle  and struck up a tune  and at the first  note judge  clerks  and jailer were in motion  all began capering  and  no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his  prisoner go  and danced also  and by the time he had played the first  bar of the tune  all were dancing together  judge  court  and miser  and  all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry  and pleasant enough  but when it had gone on a while  and there seemed  to be no end of playing or dancing  they began to cry out  and beg him  to leave off  but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties   till the judge not only gave him his life  but promised to return him  the hundred florins.    Then he called to the miser  and said  â  Tell us now  you vagabond  where  you got that gold  or I shall play on for your amusement only â   â  I stole  it â   said the miser in the presence of all the people  â  I acknowledge  that I stole it  and that you earned it fairly.â   Then the countryman  stopped his fiddle  and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.          ASHPUTTEL      The wife of a rich man fell sick  and when she felt that her end drew  nigh  she called her only daughter to her bed side  and said  â  Always be  a good girl  and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.â   Soon  afterwards she shut her eyes and died  and was buried in the garden   and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept  and was always  good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful  white covering over the grave  but by the time the spring came  and the  sun had melted it away again  her father had married another wife. This  new wife had two daughters of her own  that she brought home with her   they were fair in face but foul at heart  and it was now a sorry time  for the poor little girl. â  What does the good for nothing want in the  parlour â   said they  â  they who would eat bread should first earn it   away with the kitchen maid â   Then they took away her fine clothes  and  gave her an old grey frock to put on  and laughed at her  and turned her  into the kitchen.    There she was forced to do hard work  to rise early before daylight  to  bring the water  to make the fire  to cook and to wash. Besides that   the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways  and laughed at her. In the  evening when she was tired  she had no bed to lie down on  but was made  to lie by the hearth among the ashes  and as this  of course  made her  always dusty and dirty  they called her Ashputtel.    It happened once that the father was going to the fair  and asked his  wifeâ  s daughters what he should bring them. â  Fine clothes â   said the  first  â  Pearls and diamonds â   cried the second. â  Now  child â   said he  to his own daughter  â  what will you have â   â  The first twig  dear  father  that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come  homewards â   said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes  and pearls and diamonds they had asked for  and on his way home  as he  rode through a green copse  a hazel twig brushed against him  and almost  pushed off his hat  so he broke it off and brought it away  and when he  got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it  and went to  her motherâ  s grave and planted it there  and cried so much that it was  watered with her tears  and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three  times every day she went to it and cried  and soon a little bird came  and built its nest upon the tree  and talked with her  and watched over  her  and brought her whatever she wished for.    Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast  which was to  last three days  and out of those who came to it his son was to choose  a bride for himself. Ashputtelâ  s two sisters were asked to come  so they  called her up  and said  â  Now  comb our hair  brush our shoes  and tie  our sashes for us  for we are going to dance at the kingâ  s feast.â    Then she did as she was told  but when all was done she could not help  crying  for she thought to herself  she should so have liked to have  gone with them to the ball  and at last she begged her mother very hard  to let her go. â  You  Ashputtel â   said she  â  you who have nothing to  wear  no clothes at all  and who cannot even dance  you want to go to  the ball  And when she kept on begging  she said at last  to get rid of  her  â  I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash heap  and if in  two hoursâ   time you have picked them all out  you shall go to the feast  too.â      Then she threw the peas down among the ashes  but the little maiden ran  out at the back door into the garden  and cried out      â  Hither  hither  through the sky     Turtle doves and linnets  fly     Blackbird  thrush  and chaffinch gay     Hither  hither  haste away     One and all come help me  quick     Haste ye  haste ye   pick  pick  pick â      Then first came two white doves  flying in at the kitchen window  next  came two turtle doves  and after them came all the little birds under  heaven  chirping and fluttering in  and they flew down into the ashes.  And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work  pick   pick  pick  and then the others began to pick  pick  pick  and among  them all they soon picked out all the good grain  and put it into a dish  but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite  done  and all flew out again at the windows.    Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother  overjoyed at the thought  that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said  â  No  no  you  slut  you have no clothes  and cannot dance  you shall not go.â   And when  Ashputtel begged very hard to go  she said  â  If you can in one hourâ  s  time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes  you shall go  too.â   And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she  shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.    But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house   and cried out as before      â  Hither  hither  through the sky     Turtle doves and linnets  fly     Blackbird  thrush  and chaffinch gay     Hither  hither  haste away     One and all come help me  quick     Haste ye  haste ye   pick  pick  pick â      Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window  next came two  turtle doves  and after them came all the little birds under heaven   chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes  and the  little doves put their heads down and set to work  pick  pick  pick  and  then the others began pick  pick  pick  and they put all the good grain  into the dishes  and left all the ashes. Before half an hourâ  s time all  was done  and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to  her mother  rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.  But her mother said  â  It is all of no use  you cannot go  you have no  clothes  and cannot dance  and you would only put us to shameâ    and off  she went with her two daughters to the ball.    Now when all were gone  and nobody left at home  Ashputtel went  sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel tree  and cried out      â  Shake  shake  hazel tree     Gold and silver over me â      Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree  and brought a gold and  silver dress for her  and slippers of spangled silk  and she put them  on  and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her   and thought it must be some strange princess  she looked so fine and  beautiful in her rich clothes  and they never once thought of Ashputtel   taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.    The kingâ  s son soon came up to her  and took her by the hand and danced  with her  and no one else  and he never left her hand  but when anyone  else came to ask her to dance  he said  â  This lady is dancing with me.â      Thus they danced till a late hour of the night  and then she wanted to  go home  and the kingâ  s son said  â  I shall go and take care of you to  your homeâ    for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But  she slipped away from him  unawares  and ran off towards home  and as  the prince followed her  she jumped up into the pigeon house and shut  the door. Then he waited till her father came home  and told him that  the unknown maiden  who had been at the feast  had hid herself in the  pigeon house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one  within  and as they came back into the house  Ashputtel was lying  as  she always did  in her dirty frock by the ashes  and her dim little  lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could  through the pigeon house and on to the hazel tree  and had there taken  off her beautiful clothes  and put them beneath the tree  that the bird  might carry them away  and had lain down again amid the ashes in her  little grey frock.    The next day when the feast was again held  and her father  mother  and  sisters were gone  Ashputtel went to the hazel tree  and said      â  Shake  shake  hazel tree     Gold and silver over me â      And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she  had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball  everyone  wondered at her beauty  but the kingâ  s son  who was waiting for her   took her by the hand  and danced with her  and when anyone asked her to  dance  he said as before  â  This lady is dancing with me.â      When night came she wanted to go home  and the kingâ  s son followed here  as before  that he might see into what house she went  but she sprang  away from him all at once into the garden behind her fatherâ  s house.  In this garden stood a fine large pear tree full of ripe fruit  and  Ashputtel  not knowing where to hide herself  jumped up into it without  being seen. Then the kingâ  s son lost sight of her  and could not find  out where she was gone  but waited till her father came home  and said  to him  â  The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away  and I  think she must have sprung into the pear tree.â   The father thought to  himself  â  Can it be Ashputtel â   So he had an axe brought  and they cut  down the tree  but found no one upon it. And when they came back into  the kitchen  there lay Ashputtel among the ashes  for she had slipped  down on the other side of the tree  and carried her beautiful clothes  back to the bird at the hazel tree  and then put on her little grey  frock.    The third day  when her father and mother and sisters were gone  she  went again into the garden  and said      â  Shake  shake  hazel tree     Gold and silver over me â      Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the  former one  and slippers which were all of gold  so that when she came  to the feast no one knew what to say  for wonder at her beauty  and the  kingâ  s son danced with nobody but her  and when anyone else asked her to  dance  he said  â  This lady is _my_ partner  sir.â      When night came she wanted to go home  and the kingâ  s son would go with  her  and said to himself  â  I will not lose her this timeâ    but  however   she again slipped away from him  though in such a hurry that she dropped  her left golden slipper upon the stairs.    The prince took the shoe  and went the next day to the king his father   and said  â  I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper  fits.â   Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it  for they  had beautiful feet  and had no doubt that they could wear the golden  slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was  and  wanted to try it on  and the mother stood by. But her great toe could  not go into it  and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then  the mother gave her a knife  and said  â  Never mind  cut it off  when you  are queen you will not care about toes  you will not want to walk.â   So  the silly girl cut off her great toe  and thus squeezed on the shoe   and went to the kingâ  s son. Then he took her for his bride  and set her  beside him on his horse  and rode away with her homewards.    But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel tree that Ashputtel  had planted  and on the branch sat a little dove singing      â  Back again  back again  look to the shoe     The shoe is too small  and not made for you     Prince  prince  look again for thy bride     For sheâ  s not the true one that sits by thy side.â      Then the prince got down and looked at her foot  and he saw  by the  blood that streamed from it  what a trick she had played him. So he  turned his horse round  and brought the false bride back to her home   and said  â  This is not the right bride  let the other sister try and put  on the slipper.â   Then she went into the room and got her foot into the  shoe  all but the heel  which was too large. But her mother squeezed it  in till the blood came  and took her to the kingâ  s son  and he set her  as his bride by his side on his horse  and rode away with her.    But when they came to the hazel tree the little dove sat there still   and sang      â  Back again  back again  look to the shoe     The shoe is too small  and not made for you     Prince  prince  look again for thy bride     For sheâ  s not the true one that sits by thy side.â      Then he looked down  and saw that the blood streamed so much from the  shoe  that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse  and brought her also back again. â  This is not the true bride â   said he  to the father  â  have you no other daughters â   â  No â   said he  â  there is  only a little dirty Ashputtel here  the child of my first wife  I am  sure she cannot be the bride.â   The prince told him to send her. But the  mother said  â  No  no  she is much too dirty  she will not dare to show  herself.â   However  the prince would have her come  and she first washed  her face and hands  and then went in and curtsied to him  and he reached  her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot   and put on the golden slipper  and it fitted her as if it had been made  for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her  and  said  â  This is the right bride.â   But the mother and both the sisters  were frightened  and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his  horse  and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel tree  the  white dove sang      â  Home  home  look at the shoe     Princess  the shoe was made for you     Prince  prince  take home thy bride     For she is the true one that sits by thy side â      And when the dove had done its song  it came flying  and perched upon  her right shoulder  and so went home with her.          THE WHITE SNAKE      A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through  all the land. Nothing was hidden from him  and it seemed as if news of  the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a  strange custom  every day after dinner  when the table was cleared   and no one else was present  a trusty servant had to bring him one more  dish. It was covered  however  and even the servant did not know what  was in it  neither did anyone know  for the king never took off the  cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.    This had gone on for a long time  when one day the servant  who took  away the dish  was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help  carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door   he lifted up the cover  and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But  when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it   so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it  touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices  outside his window. He went and listened  and then noticed that it was  the sparrows who were chattering together  and telling one another of  all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating  the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.    Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most  beautiful ring  and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty  servant  who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to  be brought before him  and threatened with angry words that unless he  could before the morrow point out the thief  he himself should be looked  upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence  he was  dismissed with no better answer.    In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought  how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting  together quietly by a brook and taking their rest  and  whilst they  were making their feathers smooth with their bills  they were having a  confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.  They were telling one another of all the places where they had been  waddling about all the morning  and what good food they had found  and  one said in a pitiful tone  â  Something lies heavy on my stomach  as  I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queenâ  s  window.â   The servant at once seized her by the neck  carried her to the  kitchen  and said to the cook  â  Here is a fine duck  pray  kill her.â    â  Yes â   said the cook  and weighed her in his hand  â  she has spared  no trouble to fatten herself  and has been waiting to be roasted long  enough.â   So he cut off her head  and as she was being dressed for the  spit  the queenâ  s ring was found inside her.    The servant could now easily prove his innocence  and the king  to make  amends for the wrong  allowed him to ask a favour  and promised him  the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused  everything  and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling  as  he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request  was granted he set out on his way  and one day came to a pond  where he  saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now  though  it is said that fishes are dumb  he heard them lamenting that they must  perish so miserably  and  as he had a kind heart  he got off his  horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with  delight  put out their heads  and cried to him  â  We will remember you  and repay you for saving us â      He rode on  and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in  the sand at his feet. He listened  and heard an ant king complain  â  Why  cannot folks  with their clumsy beasts  keep off our bodies  That stupid  horse  with his heavy hoofs  has been treading down my people without  mercy â   So he turned on to a side path and the ant king cried out to  him  â  We will remember you  one good turn deserves another â      The path led him into a wood  and there he saw two old ravens standing  by their nest  and throwing out their young ones. â  Out with you  you  idle  good for nothing creatures â   cried they  â  we cannot find food for  you any longer  you are big enough  and can provide for yourselves.â    But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground  flapping their wings  and  crying  â  Oh  what helpless chicks we are  We must shift for ourselves   and yet we cannot fly  What can we do  but lie here and starve â   So the  good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword  and gave  it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it  satisfied their  hunger  and cried  â  We will remember you  one good turn deserves  another â      And now he had to use his own legs  and when he had walked a long  way  he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in  the streets  and a man rode up on horseback  crying aloud  â  The kingâ  s  daughter wants a husband  but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard  task  and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.â   Many had  already made the attempt  but in vain  nevertheless when the youth  saw the kingâ  s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he  forgot all danger  went before the king  and declared himself a suitor.    So he was led out to the sea  and a gold ring was thrown into it  before  his eyes  then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the  bottom of the sea  and added  â  If you come up again without it you will  be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.â   All the  people grieved for the handsome youth  then they went away  leaving him  alone by the sea.    He stood on the shore and considered what he should do  when suddenly  he saw three fishes come swimming towards him  and they were the very  fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in  its mouth  which it laid on the shore at the youthâ  s feet  and when he  had taken it up and opened it  there lay the gold ring in the shell.  Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him  the promised reward.    But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in  birth  she scorned him  and required him first to perform another  task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten  sacksful of millet seed on the grass  then she said  â  Tomorrow morning  before sunrise these must be picked up  and not a single grain be  wanting.â      The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible  to perform this task  but he could think of nothing  and there he sat  sorrowfully awaiting the break of day  when he should be led to death.  But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw  all the ten sacks standing side by side  quite full  and not a single  grain was missing. The ant king had come in the night with thousands  and thousands of ants  and the grateful creatures had by great industry  picked up all the millet seed and gathered them into the sacks.    Presently the kingâ  s daughter herself came down into the garden  and was  amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.  But she could not yet conquer her proud heart  and said  â  Although he  has performed both the tasks  he shall not be my husband until he had  brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.â   The youth did not know where  the Tree of Life stood  but he set out  and would have gone on for ever   as long as his legs would carry him  though he had no hope of finding  it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms  he came one evening to  a wood  and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in  the branches  and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time  three ravens flew down to him  perched themselves upon his knee  and  said  â  We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving  when  we had grown big  and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple   we flew over the sea to the end of the world  where the Tree of Life  stands  and have brought you the apple.â   The youth  full of joy  set out  homewards  and took the Golden Apple to the kingâ  s beautiful daughter   who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in  two and ate it together  and then her heart became full of love for him   and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.          THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS      There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids  and  loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she  wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all  seven to her and said  â  Dear children  I have to go into the forest   be on your guard against the wolf  if he comes in  he will devour you  all  skin  hair  and everything. The wretch often disguises himself  but  you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.â   The  kids said  â  Dear mother  we will take good care of ourselves  you may go  away without any anxiety.â   Then the old one bleated  and went on her way  with an easy mind.    It was not long before someone knocked at the house door and called   â  Open the door  dear children  your mother is here  and has brought  something back with her for each of you.â   But the little kids knew that  it was the wolf  by the rough voice. â  We will not open the door â   cried  they  â  you are not our mother. She has a soft  pleasant voice  but  your voice is rough  you are the wolf â   Then the wolf went away to a  shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk  ate this and made  his voice soft with it. Then he came back  knocked at the door of the  house  and called  â  Open the door  dear children  your mother is here  and has brought something back with her for each of you.â   But the wolf  had laid his black paws against the window  and the children saw them  and cried  â  We will not open the door  our mother has not black feet  like you  you are the wolf â   Then the wolf ran to a baker and said  â  I  have hurt my feet  rub some dough over them for me.â   And when the baker  had rubbed his feet over  he ran to the miller and said  â  Strew some  white meal over my feet for me.â   The miller thought to himself  â  The  wolf wants to deceive someone â   and refused  but the wolf said  â  If you  will not do it  I will devour you.â   Then the miller was afraid  and made  his paws white for him. Truly  this is the way of mankind.    So now the wretch went for the third time to the house door  knocked at  it and said  â  Open the door for me  children  your dear little mother  has come home  and has brought every one of you something back from the  forest with her.â   The little kids cried  â  First show us your paws that  we may know if you are our dear little mother.â   Then he put his paws  in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white  they  believed that all he said was true  and opened the door. But who should  come in but the wolf  They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.  One sprang under the table  the second into the bed  the third into the  stove  the fourth into the kitchen  the fifth into the cupboard  the  sixth under the washing bowl  and the seventh into the clock case. But  the wolf found them all  and used no great ceremony  one after the  other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest  who was in  the clock case  was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had  satisfied his appetite he took himself off  laid himself down under a  tree in the green meadow outside  and began to sleep. Soon afterwards  the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah  what a sight she saw  there  The house door stood wide open. The table  chairs  and benches  were thrown down  the washing bowl lay broken to pieces  and the quilts  and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children  but they  were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name  but  no one answered. At last  when she came to the youngest  a soft voice  cried  â  Dear mother  I am in the clock case.â   She took the kid out  and  it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then  you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.    At length in her grief she went out  and the youngest kid ran with her.  When they came to the meadow  there lay the wolf by the tree and snored  so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and  saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. â  Ah   heavens â   she said  â  is it possible that my poor children whom he has  swallowed down for his supper  can be still alive â   Then the kid had to  run home and fetch scissors  and a needle and thread  and the goat cut  open the monsterâ  s stomach  and hardly had she made one cut  than one  little kid thrust its head out  and when she had cut farther  all six  sprang out one after another  and were all still alive  and had suffered  no injury whatever  for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them  down whole. What rejoicing there was  They embraced their dear mother   and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother  however  said  â  Now  go and look for some big stones  and we will fill the wicked beastâ  s  stomach with them while he is still asleep.â   Then the seven kids dragged  the stones thither with all speed  and put as many of them into this  stomach as they could get in  and the mother sewed him up again in the  greatest haste  so that he was not aware of anything and never once  stirred.    When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep  he got on his legs   and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty  he wanted to  go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about  the  stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried  he      â  What rumbles and tumbles    Against my poor bones     I thought â  twas six kids     But it feels like big stones.â      And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink  the  heavy stones made him fall in  and he drowned miserably. When the seven  kids saw that  they came running to the spot and cried aloud  â  The wolf  is dead  The wolf is dead â   and danced for joy round about the well with  their mother.          THE QUEEN BEE      Two kingsâ   sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their  fortunes  but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living  so  that they could not return home again. Then their brother  who was a  little insignificant dwarf  went out to seek for his brothers  but when  he had found them they only laughed at him  to think that he  who was so  young and simple  should try to travel through the world  when they  who  were so much wiser  had been unable to get on. However  they all set  out on their journey together  and came at last to an ant hill. The two  elder brothers would have pulled it down  in order to see how the poor  ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the  little dwarf said  â  Let the poor things enjoy themselves  I will not  suffer you to trouble them.â      So on they went  and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming  about. The two brothers wanted to catch two  and roast them. But the  dwarf said  â  Let the poor things enjoy themselves  you shall not kill  them.â   Next they came to a beesâ   nest in a hollow tree  and there was  so much honey that it ran down the trunk  and the two brothers wanted to  light a fire under the tree and kill the bees  so as to get their honey.  But the dwarf held them back  and said  â  Let the pretty insects enjoy  themselves  I cannot let you burn them.â      At length the three brothers came to a castle  and as they passed by the  stables they saw fine horses standing there  but all were of marble  and  no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms  till they  came to a door on which were three locks  but in the middle of the door  was a wicket  so that they could look into the next room. There they saw  a little grey old man sitting at a table  and they called to him once or  twice  but he did not hear  however  they called a third time  and then  he rose and came out to them.    He said nothing  but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful  table covered with all sorts of good things  and when they had eaten and  drunk  he showed each of them to a bed chamber.    The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table   where there were three tablets  containing an account of the means by  which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said  â  In the  wood  under the moss  lie the thousand pearls belonging to the kingâ  s  daughter  they must all be found  and if one be missing by set of sun   he who seeks them will be turned into marble.â      The eldest brother set out  and sought for the pearls the whole day   but the evening came  and he had not found the first hundred  so he was  turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.    The next day the second brother undertook the task  but he succeeded no  better than the first  for he could only find the second hundred of the  pearls  and therefore he too was turned into stone.    At last came the little dwarfâ  s turn  and he looked in the moss  but it  was so hard to find the pearls  and the job was so tiresome   so he sat  down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there  the king of the ants   whose life he had saved  came to help him  with five thousand ants  and  it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a  heap.    The second tablet said  â  The key of the princessâ  s bed chamber must be  fished up out of the lake.â   And as the dwarf came to the brink of it   he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about  and they  dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.    The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and  the best of the kingâ  s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful  and  all exactly alike  but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of  sugar  the next some sweet syrup  and the youngest a spoonful of honey   so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.    Then came the queen of the bees  who had been saved by the little dwarf  from the fire  and she tried the lips of all three  but at last she sat  upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey  and so the dwarf knew  which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken  and all who had been  turned into stones awoke  and took their proper forms. And the dwarf  married the youngest and the best of the princesses  and was king after  her fatherâ  s death  but his two brothers married the other two sisters.          THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER      There was once a shoemaker  who worked very hard and was very honest   but still he could not earn enough to live upon  and at last all he  had in the world was gone  save just leather enough to make one pair of  shoes.    Then he cut his leather out  all ready to make up the next day  meaning  to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and  his heart light amidst all his troubles  so he went peaceably to bed   left all his cares to Heaven  and soon fell asleep. In the morning after  he had said his prayers  he sat himself down to his work  when  to his  great wonder  there stood the shoes all ready made  upon the table. The  good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.  He looked at the workmanship  there was not one false stitch in the  whole job  all was so neat and true  that it was quite a masterpiece.    The same day a customer came in  and the shoes suited him so well that  he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them  and the poor  shoemaker  with the money  bought leather enough to make two pairs more.  In the evening he cut out the work  and went to bed early  that he might  get up and begin betimes next day  but he was saved all the trouble  for  when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon  in came buyers  who paid him handsomely for his goods  so that he bought  leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight  and found it done in the morning  as before  and so it went on for some  time  what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak  and  the good man soon became thriving and well off again.    One evening  about Christmas time  as he and his wife were sitting over  the fire chatting together  he said to her  â  I should like to sit up and  watch tonight  that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for  me.â   The wife liked the thought  so they left a light burning  and hid  themselves in a corner of the room  behind a curtain that was hung up  there  and watched what would happen.    As soon as it was midnight  there came in two little naked dwarfs  and  they sat themselves upon the shoemakerâ  s bench  took up all the work  that was cut out  and began to ply with their little fingers  stitching  and rapping and tapping away at such a rate  that the shoemaker was all  wonder  and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went  till the  job was quite done  and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.  This was long before daybreak  and then they bustled away as quick as  lightning.    The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. â  These little wights have  made us rich  and we ought to be thankful to them  and do them a good  turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do  and  indeed it is not very decent  for they have nothing upon their backs to  keep off the cold. Iâ  ll tell you what  I will make each of them a shirt   and a coat and waistcoat  and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain  and  do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.â      The thought pleased the good cobbler very much  and one evening  when  all the things were ready  they laid them on the table  instead of the  work that they used to cut out  and then went and hid themselves  to  watch what the little elves would do.    About midnight in they came  dancing and skipping  hopped round the  room  and then went to sit down to their work as usual  but when they  saw the clothes lying for them  they laughed and chuckled  and seemed  mightily delighted.    Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye  and danced and  capered and sprang about  as merry as could be  till at last they danced  out at the door  and away over the green.    The good couple saw them no more  but everything went well with them  from that time forward  as long as they lived.          THE JUNIPER TREE      Long  long ago  some two thousand years or so  there lived a rich  man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly  but  sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire  to have one  that the wife prayed for it day and night  but still they  remained childless.    In front of the house there was a court  in which grew a juniper tree.  One winterâ  s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples  and  as she was peeling them  she cut her finger  and the blood fell on the  snow. â  Ah â   sighed the woman heavily  â  if I had but a child  as red as  blood and as white as snow â   and as she spoke the words  her heart grew  light within her  and it seemed to her that her wish was granted  and  she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed   and the snow had all disappeared  then another month went by  and all  the earth was green. So the months followed one another  and first the  trees budded in the woods  and soon the green branches grew thickly  intertwined  and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife  stood under the juniper tree  and it was so full of sweet scent that her  heart leaped for joy  and she was so overcome with her happiness  that  she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm  and  she was glad and at peace  but when they were fully ripe she picked the  berries and ate eagerly of them  and then she grew sad and ill. A little  while later she called her husband  and said to him  weeping. â  If I  die  bury me under the juniper tree.â   Then she felt comforted and happy  again  and before another month had passed she had a little child  and  when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood  her joy  was so great that she died.    Her husband buried her under the juniper tree  and wept bitterly for  her. By degrees  however  his sorrow grew less  and although at times he  still grieved over his loss  he was able to go about as usual  and later  on he married again.    He now had a little daughter born to him  the child of his first wife  was a boy  who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother  loved her daughter very much  and when she looked at her and then looked  at the boy  it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in  the way of her own child  and she was continually thinking how she could  get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession  of her more and more  and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She  drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings  so that the  poor child went about in fear  and had no peace from the time he left  school to the time he went back.    One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the  store room  and said  â  Mother  give me an apple.â   â  Yes  my child â   said  the wife  and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest  the chest  had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.    â  Mother â   said the little daughter again  â  may not brother have one  too â   The mother was angry at this  but she answered  â  Yes  when he  comes out of school.â      Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming  and it seemed  as if an evil spirit entered into her  for she snatched the apple out  of her little daughterâ  s hand  and said  â  You shall not have one before  your brother.â   She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The  little boy now came in  and the evil spirit in the wife made her say  kindly to him  â  My son  will you have an apple â   but she gave him a  wicked look. â  Mother â   said the boy  â  how dreadful you look  Yes  give  me an apple.â   The thought came to her that she would kill him. â  Come  with me â   she said  and she lifted up the lid of the chest  â  take one  out for yourself.â   And as he bent over to do so  the evil spirit urged  her  and crash  down went the lid  and off went the little boyâ  s head.  Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.  â  If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it â   she thought. So  she went upstairs to her room  and took a white handkerchief out of  her top drawer  then she set the boyâ  s head again on his shoulders  and  bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen  and placed  him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.    Soon after this  little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring  a pot of boiling water over the fire  and said  â  Mother  brother is  sitting by the door with an apple in his hand  and he looks so pale   and when I asked him to give me the apple  he did not answer  and that  frightened me.â      â  Go to him again â   said her mother  â  and if he does not answer  give him  a box on the ear.â   So little Marleen went  and said  â  Brother  give me  that apple â   but he did not say a word  then she gave him a box on the  ear  and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this  that she ran  crying and screaming to her mother. â  Oh â   she said  â  I have knocked off  brotherâ  s head â   and then she wept and wept  and nothing would stop her.    â  What have you done â   said her mother  â  but no one must know about it   so you must keep silence  what is done canâ  t be undone  we will make  him into puddings.â   And she took the little boy and cut him up  made him  into puddings  and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on   and wept and wept  and her tears fell into the pot  so that there was no  need of salt.    Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner  he asked   â  Where is my son â   The mother said nothing  but gave him a large dish of  black pudding  and Marleen still wept without ceasing.    The father again asked  â  Where is my son â      â  Oh â   answered the wife  â  he is gone into the country to his motherâ  s  great uncle  he is going to stay there some time.â      â  What has he gone there for  and he never even said goodbye to me â      â  Well  he likes being there  and he told me he should be away quite six  weeks  he is well looked after there.â      â  I feel very unhappy about it â   said the husband  â  in case it should not  be all right  and he ought to have said goodbye to me.â      With this he went on with his dinner  and said  â  Little Marleen  why do  you weep  Brother will soon be back.â   Then he asked his wife for more  pudding  and as he ate  he threw the bones under the table.    Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of  her bottom drawer  and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the  table and carried them outside  and all the time she did nothing but  weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper tree  and  she had no sooner done so  then all her sadness seemed to leave her   and she wept no more. And now the juniper tree began to move  and the  branches waved backwards and forwards  first away from one another  and  then together again  as it might be someone clapping their hands for  joy. After this a mist came round the tree  and in the midst of it there  was a burning as of fire  and out of the fire there flew a beautiful  bird  that rose high into the air  singing magnificently  and when it  could no more be seen  the juniper tree stood there as before  and the  silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.    Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were  still alive  and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to  the table and ate.    The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to  sing      â  My mother killed her little son     My father grieved when I was gone     My sister loved me best of all     She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain  when he heard the  song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got  up and ran out  and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his  slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street  with a slipper on  one foot and a sock on the other  he still had on his apron  and still  held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands  and so he stood gazing  up at the bird  while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.    â  Bird â   he said  â  how beautifully you sing  Sing me that song again.â      â  Nay â   said the bird  â  I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold  chain  and I will sing it you again.â      â  Here is the chain  take it â   said the goldsmith. â  Only sing me that  again.â      The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw  and then  he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang      â  My mother killed her little son     My father grieved when I was gone     My sister loved me best of all     She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      Then he flew away  and settled on the roof of a shoemakerâ  s house and  sang      â  My mother killed her little son     My father grieved when I was gone     My sister loved me best of all     She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      The shoemaker heard him  and he jumped up and ran out in his  shirt sleeves  and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his  hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.    â  Bird â   he said  â  how beautifully you sing â   Then he called through the  door to his wife  â  Wife  come out  here is a bird  come and look at it  and hear how beautifully it sings.â   Then he called his daughter and the  children  then the apprentices  girls and boys  and they all ran up the  street to look at the bird  and saw how splendid it was with its red  and green feathers  and its neck like burnished gold  and eyes like two  bright stars in its head.    â  Bird â   said the shoemaker  â  sing me that song again.â      â  Nay â   answered the bird  â  I do not sing twice for nothing  you must  give me something.â      â  Wife â   said the man  â  go into the garret  on the upper shelf you will  see a pair of red shoes  bring them to me.â   The wife went in and fetched  the shoes.    â  There  bird â   said the shoemaker  â  now sing me that song again.â      The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw  and then he  went back to the roof and sang      â  My mother killed her little son     My father grieved when I was gone     My sister loved me best of all     She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      When he had finished  he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw  and the shoes in his left  and he flew right away to a mill  and the  mill went â  Click clack  click clack  click clack.â   Inside the mill were  twenty of the millerâ  s men hewing a stone  and as they went â  Hick hack   hick hack  hick hack â   the mill went â  Click clack  click clack  click  clack.â      The bird settled on a lime tree in front of the mill and sang      â  My mother killed her little son     then one of the men left off       My father grieved when I was gone     two more men left off and listened       My sister loved me best of all     then four more left off       She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    now there were only eight at work       Underneath    And now only five       the juniper tree.    And now only one       Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      then he looked up and the last one had left off work.    â  Bird â   he said  â  what a beautiful song that is you sing  Let me hear it  too  sing it again.â      â  Nay â   answered the bird  â  I do not sing twice for nothing  give me that  millstone  and I will sing it again.â      â  If it belonged to me alone â   said the man  â  you should have it.â      â  Yes  yes â   said the others  â  if he will sing again  he can have it.â      The bird came down  and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the  stone with a beam  then the bird put his head through the hole and took  the stone round his neck like a collar  and flew back with it to the  tree and sang       â  My mother killed her little son     My father grieved when I was gone     My sister loved me best of all     She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      And when he had finished his song  he spread his wings  and with the  chain in his right claw  the shoes in his left  and the millstone round  his neck  he flew right away to his fatherâ  s house.    The father  the mother  and little Marleen were having their dinner.    â  How lighthearted I feel â   said the father  â  so pleased and cheerful.â      â  And I â   said the mother  â  I feel so uneasy  as if a heavy thunderstorm  were coming.â      But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.    Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.    â  I do feel so happy â   said the father  â  and how beautifully the sun  shines  I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.â      â  Ah â   said the wife  â  and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that  my teeth chatter  and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins â   and  she tore open her dress  and all the while little Marleen sat in the  corner and wept  and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.    The bird now flew to the juniper tree and began singing      â  My mother killed her little son     the mother shut her eyes and her ears  that she might see and hear  nothing  but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a  violent storm  and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning       My father grieved when I was gone     â  Look  mother â   said the man  â  at the beautiful bird that is singing so  magnificently  and how warm and bright the sun is  and what a delicious  scent of spice in the air â        My sister loved me best of all     then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.    â  I must go outside and see the bird nearer â   said the man.    â  Ah  do not go â   cried the wife. â  I feel as if the whole house were in  flames â      But the man went out and looked at the bird.     She laid her kerchief over me    And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper tree   Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      With that the bird let fall the gold chain  and it fell just round the  manâ  s neck  so that it fitted him exactly.    He went inside  and said  â  See  what a splendid bird that is  he has  given me this beautiful gold chain  and looks so beautiful himself.â      But the wife was in such fear and trouble  that she fell on the floor   and her cap fell from her head.    Then the bird began again      â  My mother killed her little son     â  Ah me â   cried the wife  â  if I were but a thousand feet beneath the  earth  that I might not hear that song.â        My father grieved when I was gone     then the woman fell down again as if dead.      My sister loved me best of all     â  Well â   said little Marleen  â  I will go out too and see if the bird will  give me anything.â      So she went out.      She laid her kerchief over me     And took my bones that they might lie    and he threw down the shoes to her       Underneath the juniper tree    Kywitt  Kywitt  what a beautiful bird am I â      And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted  she put on the shoes and  danced and jumped about in them. â  I was so miserable â   she said  â  when I  came out  but that has all passed away  that is indeed a splendid bird   and he has given me a pair of red shoes.â      The wife sprang up  with her hair standing out from her head like flames  of fire. â  Then I will go out too â   she said  â  and see if it will lighten  my misery  for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.â      But as she crossed the threshold  crash  the bird threw the millstone  down on her head  and she was crushed to death.    The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out  but they only  saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot  and when these had  passed  there stood the little brother  and he took the father and  little Marleen by the hand  then they all three rejoiced  and went  inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.          THE TURNIP      There were two brothers who were both soldiers  the one was rich and  the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself  so   pulling off his red coat  he became a gardener  and dug his ground well   and sowed turnips.    When the seed came up  there was one plant bigger than all the rest  and  it kept getting larger and larger  and seemed as if it would never cease  growing  so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for  there never was such a one seen before  and never will again. At last it  was so big that it filled a cart  and two oxen could hardly draw it  and  the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it  nor whether it  would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself  â  What  shall I do with it  if I sell it  it will bring no more than another   and for eating  the little turnips are better than this  the best thing  perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.â      Then he yoked his oxen  and drew the turnip to the court  and gave it  to the king. â  What a wonderful thing â   said the king  â  I have seen many  strange things  but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you  get the seed  or is it only your good luck  If so  you are a true child  of fortune.â   â  Ah  no â   answered the gardener  â  I am no child of fortune   I am a poor soldier  who never could get enough to live upon  so I  laid aside my red coat  and set to work  tilling the ground. I have a  brother  who is rich  and your majesty knows him well  and all the world  knows him  but because I am poor  everybody forgets me.â      The king then took pity on him  and said  â  You shall be poor no  longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your  brother.â   Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks  and made him so  rich that his brotherâ  s fortune could not at all be compared with his.    When the brother heard of all this  and how a turnip had made the  gardener so rich  he envied him sorely  and bethought himself how he  could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However  he  determined to manage more cleverly than his brother  and got together a  rich present of gold and fine horses for the king  and thought he must  have a much larger gift in return  for if his brother had received so  much for only a turnip  what must his present be worth     The king took the gift very graciously  and said he knew not what to  give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip  so  the soldier was forced to put it into a cart  and drag it home with him.  When he reached home  he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite   and at length wicked thoughts came into his head  and he resolved to  kill his brother.    So he hired some villains to murder him  and having shown them where to  lie in ambush  he went to his brother  and said  â  Dear brother  I have  found a hidden treasure  let us go and dig it up  and share it between  us.â   The other had no suspicions of his roguery  so they went out  together  and as they were travelling along  the murderers rushed out  upon him  bound him  and were going to hang him on a tree.    But whilst they were getting all ready  they heard the trampling of a  horse at a distance  which so frightened them that they pushed their  prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack  and swung him up by a  cord to the tree  where they left him dangling  and ran away. Meantime  he worked and worked away  till he made a hole large enough to put out  his head.    When the horseman came up  he proved to be a student  a merry fellow   who was journeying along on his nag  and singing as he went. As soon as  the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree  he cried out  â  Good  morning  good morning to thee  my friend â   The student looked about  everywhere  and seeing no one  and not knowing where the voice came  from  cried out  â  Who calls me â      Then the man in the tree answered  â  Lift up thine eyes  for behold here  I sit in the sack of wisdom  here have I  in a short time  learned great  and wondrous things. Compared to this seat  all the learning of the  schools is as empty air. A little longer  and I shall know all that man  can know  and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here  I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars  the laws  that control the winds  the number of the sands on the seashore  the  healing of the sick  the virtues of all simples  of birds  and of  precious stones. Wert thou but once here  my friend  though wouldst feel  and own the power of knowledge.    The student listened to all this and wondered much  at last he said   â  Blessed be the day and hour when I found you  cannot you contrive to  let me into the sack for a little while â   Then the other answered  as if  very unwillingly  â  A little space I may allow thee to sit here  if thou  wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly  but thou must tarry yet an  hour below  till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown  to me.â      So the student sat himself down and waited a while  but the time hung  heavy upon him  and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith   for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give  way  and said  â  Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend  by untying  yonder cord  and then thou shalt enter.â   So the student let him down   opened the sack  and set him free. â  Now then â   cried he  â  let me ascend  quickly.â   As he began to put himself into the sack heels first  â  Wait a  while â   said the gardener  â  that is not the way.â   Then he pushed him  in head first  tied up the sack  and soon swung up the searcher after  wisdom dangling in the air. â  How is it with thee  friend â   said he   â  dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee  Rest there in peace   till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.â      So saying  he trotted off on the studentâ  s nag  and left the poor fellow  to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.

Then Gretel became angry  tore herself  loose and ran away  and was no longer the bride of Hans.          THE THREE LANGUAGES      An aged count once lived in Switzerland  who had an only son  but he  was stupid  and could learn nothing. Then said the father  â  Hark you   my son  try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from  hence  I will give you into the care of a celebrated master  who shall  see what he can do with you.â   The youth was sent into a strange town   and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time   he came home again  and his father asked  â  Now  my son  what have you  learnt â   â  Father  I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.â   â  Lord  have mercy on us â   cried the father  â  is that all you have learnt  I  will send you into another town  to another master.â   The youth was taken  thither  and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back  the father again asked  â  My son  what have you learnt â   He answered   â  Father  I have learnt what the birds say.â   Then the father fell into a  rage and said  â  Oh  you lost man  you have spent the precious time and  learnt nothing  are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes  I will  send you to a third master  but if you learn nothing this time also  I  will no longer be your father.â   The youth remained a whole year with the  third master also  and when he came home again  and his father inquired   â  My son  what have you learnt â   he answered  â  Dear father  I have this  year learnt what the frogs croak.â   Then the father fell into the most  furious anger  sprang up  called his people thither  and said  â  This man  is no longer my son  I drive him forth  and command you to take him  out into the forest  and kill him.â   They took him forth  but when they  should have killed him  they could not do it for pity  and let him go   and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry  them to the old man as a token.    The youth wandered on  and after some time came to a fortress where he  begged for a nightâ  s lodging. â  Yes â   said the lord of the castle  â  if  you will pass the night down there in the old tower  go thither  but I  warn you  it is at the peril of your life  for it is full of wild dogs   which bark and howl without stopping  and at certain hours a man has to  be given to them  whom they at once devour.â   The whole district was in  sorrow and dismay because of them  and yet no one could do anything to  stop this. The youth  however  was without fear  and said  â  Just let me  go down to the barking dogs  and give me something that I can throw to  them  they will do nothing to harm me.â   As he himself would have it so   they gave him some food for the wild animals  and led him down to the  tower. When he went inside  the dogs did not bark at him  but wagged  their tails quite amicably around him  ate what he set before them  and  did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning  to the astonishment of  everyone  he came out again safe and unharmed  and said to the lord of  the castle  â  The dogs have revealed to me  in their own language  why  they dwell there  and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched  and  are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower   and they can have no rest until it is taken away  and I have likewise  learnt  from their discourse  how that is to be done.â   Then all who  heard this rejoiced  and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him  as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again  and  as he knew what he had to do  he did it thoroughly  and brought a chest  full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth  heard no more  they had disappeared  and the country was freed from the  trouble.    After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On  the way he passed by a marsh  in which a number of frogs were sitting  croaking. He listened to them  and when he became aware of what they  were saying  he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in  Rome  where the Pope had just died  and there was great doubt among  the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at  length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be  distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was  decided on  the young count entered into the church  and suddenly two  snow white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The  ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above  and asked him on  the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided  and knew not if he were  worthy of this  but the doves counselled him to do it  and at length he  said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated  and thus was fulfilled  what he had heard from the frogs on his way  which had so affected him   that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass  and  did not know one word of it  but the two doves sat continually on his  shoulders  and said it all in his ear.          THE FOX AND THE CAT      It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest  and as she thought to  herself  â  He is clever and full of experience  and much esteemed in the  world â   she spoke to him in a friendly way. â  Good day  dear Mr Fox   how are you  How is all with you  How are you getting on in these hard  times â   The fox  full of all kinds of arrogance  looked at the cat from  head to foot  and for a long time did not know whether he would give  any answer or not. At last he said  â  Oh  you wretched beard cleaner  you  piebald fool  you hungry mouse hunter  what can you be thinking of  Have  you the cheek to ask how I am getting on  What have you learnt  How  many arts do you understand â   â  I understand but one â   replied the  cat  modestly. â  What art is that â   asked the fox. â  When the hounds are  following me  I can spring into a tree and save myself.â   â  Is that all â    said the fox. â  I am master of a hundred arts  and have into the bargain  a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you  come with me  I will  teach you how people get away from the hounds.â   Just then came a hunter  with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree  and sat down at the top  of it  where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. â  Open your  sack  Mr Fox  open your sack â   cried the cat to him  but the dogs had  already seized him  and were holding him fast. â  Ah  Mr Fox â   cried the  cat. â  You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch  Had you been  able to climb like me  you would not have lost your life.â            THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS      â  Dear children â   said a poor man to his four sons  â  I have nothing to  give you  you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin  by learning some craft or another  and see how you can get on.â   So the  four brothers took their walking sticks in their hands  and their little  bundles on their shoulders  and after bidding their father goodbye  went  all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came  to four crossways  each leading to a different country. Then the eldest  said  â  Here we must part  but this day four years we will come back  to this spot  and in the meantime each must try what he can do for  himself.â      So each brother went his way  and as the eldest was hastening on a man  met him  and asked him where he was going  and what he wanted. â  I am  going to try my luck in the world  and should like to begin by learning  some art or trade â   answered he. â  Then â   said the man  â  go with me  and  I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.â   â  No â    said the other  â  that is not an honest calling  and what can one look  to earn by it in the end but the gallows â   â  Oh â   said the man  â  you need  not fear the gallows  for I will only teach you to steal what will be  fair game  I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care  anything about  and where no one can find you out.â   So the young man  agreed to follow his trade  and he soon showed himself so clever  that  nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.    The second brother also met a man  who  when he found out what he was  setting out upon  asked him what craft he meant to follow. â  I do not  know yet â   said he. â  Then come with me  and be a star gazer. It is a  noble art  for nothing can be hidden from you  when once you understand  the stars.â   The plan pleased him much  and he soon became such a skilful  star gazer  that when he had served out his time  and wanted to leave  his master  he gave him a glass  and said  â  With this you can see all  that is passing in the sky and on earth  and nothing can be hidden from  you.â      The third brother met a huntsman  who took him with him  and taught him  so well all that belonged to hunting  that he became very clever in the  craft of the woods  and when he left his master he gave him a bow  and  said  â  Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.â      The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to  do. â  Would not you like â   said he  â  to be a tailor â   â  Oh  no â   said  the young man  â  sitting cross legged from morning to night  working  backwards and forwards with a needle and goose  will never suit me.â    â  Oh â   answered the man  â  that is not my sort of tailoring  come with me   and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.â   Not knowing  what better to do  he came into the plan  and learnt tailoring from the  beginning  and when he left his master  he gave him a needle  and said   â  You can sew anything with this  be it as soft as an egg or as hard as  steel  and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.â      After the space of four years  at the time agreed upon  the four  brothers met at the four cross roads  and having welcomed each other   set off towards their fatherâ  s home  where they told him all that had  happened to them  and how each had learned some craft.    Then  one day  as they were sitting before the house under a very high  tree  the father said  â  I should like to try what each of you can do in  this way.â   So he looked up  and said to the second son  â  At the top of  this tree there is a chaffinchâ  s nest  tell me how many eggs there are  in it.â   The star gazer took his glass  looked up  and said  â  Five.â    â  Now â   said the father to the eldest son  â  take away the eggs without  letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know  anything of what you are doing.â   So the cunning thief climbed up the  tree  and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird   and it never saw or felt what he was doing  but kept sitting on at its  ease. Then the father took the eggs  and put one on each corner of the  table  and the fifth in the middle  and said to the huntsman  â  Cut all  the eggs in two pieces at one shot.â   The huntsman took up his bow  and  at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.    â  Now comes your turn â   said he to the young tailor  â  sew the eggs and  the young birds in them together again  so neatly that the shot shall  have done them no harm.â   Then the tailor took his needle  and sewed the  eggs as he was told  and when he had done  the thief was sent to take  them back to the nest  and put them under the bird without its knowing  it. Then she went on sitting  and hatched them  and in a few days they  crawled out  and had only a little red streak across their necks  where  the tailor had sewn them together.    â  Well done  sons â   said the old man  â  you have made good use of your  time  and learnt something worth the knowing  but I am sure I do not  know which ought to have the prize. Oh  that a time might soon come for  you to turn your skill to some account â      Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country  for the  kingâ  s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon  and the king  mourned over his loss day and night  and made it known that whoever  brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four  brothers said to each other  â  Here is a chance for us  let us try  what we can do.â   And they agreed to see whether they could not set the  princess free. â  I will soon find out where she is  however â   said the  star gazer  as he looked through his glass  and he soon cried out  â  I  see her afar off  sitting upon a rock in the sea  and I can spy the  dragon close by  guarding her.â   Then he went to the king  and asked for  a ship for himself and his brothers  and they sailed together over the  sea  till they came to the right place. There they found the princess  sitting  as the star gazer had said  on the rock  and the dragon was  lying asleep  with his head upon her lap. â  I dare not shoot at him â    said the huntsman  â  for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.â    â  Then I will try my skill â   said the thief  and went and stole her away  from under the dragon  so quietly and gently that the beast did not know  it  but went on snoring.    Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the  ship  but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air  for  he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat  and  wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess  the huntsman took  up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down  dead. They were still not safe  for he was such a great beast that in  his fall he overset the boat  and they had to swim in the open sea  upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle  and with a few large  stitches put some of the planks together  and he sat down upon these   and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat  and then tacked  them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready  and they then  reached the ship and got home safe.    When they had brought home the princess to her father  there was great  rejoicing  and he said to the four brothers  â  One of you shall marry  her  but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.â   Then  there arose a quarrel between them  and the star gazer said  â  If I had  not found the princess out  all your skill would have been of no use   therefore she ought to be mine.â   â  Your seeing her would have been of  no use â   said the thief  â  if I had not taken her away from the dragon   therefore she ought to be mine.â   â  No  she is mine â   said the huntsman   â  for if I had not killed the dragon  he would  after all  have torn you  and the princess into pieces.â   â  And if I had not sewn the boat together  again â   said the tailor  â  you would all have been drowned  therefore she  is mine.â   Then the king put in a word  and said  â  Each of you is right   and as all cannot have the young lady  the best way is for neither of  you to have her  for the truth is  there is somebody she likes a great  deal better. But to make up for your loss  I will give each of you  as a  reward for his skill  half a kingdom.â   So the brothers agreed that this  plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who  had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom   as he had said  and they lived very happily the rest of their days  and  took good care of their father  and somebody took better care of the  young lady  than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have  her again.          LILY AND THE LION      A merchant  who had three daughters  was once setting out upon a  journey  but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should  bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls  the second for jewels   but the third  who was called Lily  said  â  Dear father  bring me a  rose.â   Now it was no easy task to find a rose  for it was the middle  of winter  yet as she was his prettiest daughter  and was very fond of  flowers  her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all  three  and bid them goodbye.    And when the time came for him to go home  he had bought pearls and  jewels for the two eldest  but he had sought everywhere in vain for the  rose  and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing  the  people laughed at him  and asked him whether he thought roses grew in  snow. This grieved him very much  for Lily was his dearest child  and as  he was journeying home  thinking what he should bring her  he came to a  fine castle  and around the castle was a garden  in one half of which it  seemed to be summer time and in the other half winter. On one side the  finest flowers were in full bloom  and on the other everything looked  dreary and buried in the snow. â  A lucky hit â   said he  as he called to  his servant  and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was  there  and bring him away one of the finest flowers.    This done  they were riding away well pleased  when up sprang a fierce  lion  and roared out  â  Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up  alive â   Then the man said  â  I knew not that the garden belonged to you   can nothing save my life â   â  No â   said the lion  â  nothing  unless you  undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home  if you  agree to this  I will give you your life  and the rose too for your  daughter.â   But the man was unwilling to do so and said  â  It may be my  youngest daughter  who loves me most  and always runs to meet me when  I go home.â   Then the servant was greatly frightened  and said  â  It may  perhaps be only a cat or a dog.â   And at last the man yielded with a  heavy heart  and took the rose  and said he would give the lion whatever  should meet him first on his return.    And as he came near home  it was Lily  his youngest and dearest  daughter  that met him  she came running  and kissed him  and welcomed  him home  and when she saw that he had brought her the rose  she was  still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful  and to weep   saying  â  Alas  my dearest child  I have bought this flower at a high  price  for I have said I would give you to a wild lion  and when he has  you  he will tear you in pieces  and eat you.â   Then he told her all that  had happened  and said she should not go  let what would happen.    But she comforted him  and said  â  Dear father  the word you have given  must be kept  I will go to the lion  and soothe him  perhaps he will let  me come safe home again.â      The next morning she asked the way she was to go  and took leave of her  father  and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was  an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions  but in the  evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the  castle  he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The  wedding feast was held  and they lived happily together a long time. The  prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came  and then he held his  court  but every morning he left his bride  and went away by himself   she knew not whither  till the night came again.    After some time he said to her  â  Tomorrow there will be a great feast in  your fatherâ  s house  for your eldest sister is to be married  and if  you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.â   Then she  rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more  and set  out with the lions  and everyone was overjoyed to see her  for they had  thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was  and  stayed till the feast was over  and then went back to the wood.    Her second sister was soon after married  and when Lily was asked to  go to the wedding  she said to the prince  â  I will not go alone this  time  you must go with me.â   But he would not  and said that it would be  a very hazardous thing  for if the least ray of the torch light should  fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse  for he should be  changed into a dove  and be forced to wander about the world for seven  long years. However  she gave him no rest  and said she would take care  no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together  and  took with them their little child  and she chose a large hall with thick  walls for him to sit in while the wedding torches were lighted  but   unluckily  no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the  wedding was held with great pomp  but as the train came from the church   and passed with the torches before the hall  a very small ray of light  fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared  and when his wife came  in and looked for him  she found only a white dove  and it said to her   â  Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth  but  every now and then I will let fall a white feather  that will show you  the way I am going  follow it  and at last you may overtake and set me  free.â      This said  he flew out at the door  and poor Lily followed  and every  now and then a white feather fell  and showed her the way she was to  journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world  and looked  neither to the right hand nor to the left  nor took any rest  for seven  years. Then she began to be glad  and thought to herself that the time  was fast coming when all her troubles should end  yet repose was still  far off  for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white  feather  and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.  â  Now â   thought she to herself  â  no aid of man can be of use to me.â   So  she went to the sun and said  â  Thou shinest everywhere  on the hillâ  s  top and the valleyâ  s depth  hast thou anywhere seen my white dove â    â  No â   said the sun  â  I have not seen it  but I will give thee a  casket  open it when thy hour of need comes.â      So she thanked the sun  and went on her way till eventide  and when  the moon arose  she cried unto it  and said  â  Thou shinest through the  night  over field and grove  hast thou nowhere seen my white dove â    â  No â   said the moon  â  I cannot help thee but I will give thee an  egg  break it when need comes.â      Then she thanked the moon  and went on till the night wind blew  and she  raised up her voice to it  and said  â  Thou blowest through every tree  and under every leaf  hast thou not seen my white dove â   â  No â   said the  night wind  â  but I will ask three other winds  perhaps they have seen  it.â   Then the east wind and the west wind came  and said they too had  not seen it  but the south wind said  â  I have seen the white dove  he  has fled to the Red Sea  and is changed once more into a lion  for the  seven years are passed away  and there he is fighting with a dragon   and the dragon is an enchanted princess  who seeks to separate him from  you.â   Then the night wind said  â  I will give thee counsel. Go to the  Red Sea  on the right shore stand many rods  count them  and when thou  comest to the eleventh  break it off  and smite the dragon with it  and  so the lion will have the victory  and both of them will appear to you  in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin  winged  like bird  sitting by the Red Sea  jump on to his back with thy beloved  one as quickly as possible  and he will carry you over the waters to  your home. I will also give thee this nut â   continued the night wind.  â  When you are half way over  throw it down  and out of the waters will  immediately spring up a high nut tree on which the griffin will be able  to rest  otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole  way  if  therefore  thou dost forget to throw down the nut  he will let  you both fall into the sea.â      So our poor wanderer went forth  and found all as the night wind had  said  and she plucked the eleventh rod  and smote the dragon  and the  lion forthwith became a prince  and the dragon a princess again. But  no sooner was the princess released from the spell  than she seized  the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffinâ  s back  and went off  carrying the prince away with her.    Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn  but she  took heart and said  â  As far as the wind blows  and so long as the cock  crows  I will journey on  till I find him once again.â   She went on for  a long  long way  till at length she came to the castle whither the  princess had carried the prince  and there was a feast got ready  and  she heard that the wedding was about to be held. â  Heaven aid me now â    said she  and she took the casket that the sun had given her  and found  that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it  on  and went into the palace  and all the people gazed upon her  and  the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be  sold. â  Not for gold and silver.â   said she  â  but for flesh and blood.â    The princess asked what she meant  and she said  â  Let me speak with the  bridegroom this night in his chamber  and I will give thee the dress.â    At last the princess agreed  but she told her chamberlain to give the  prince a sleeping draught  that he might not hear or see her. When  evening came  and the prince had fallen asleep  she was led into  his chamber  and she sat herself down at his feet  and said  â  I have  followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun  the moon  and the  night wind  to seek thee  and at last I have helped thee to overcome  the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite â   But the prince all the time  slept so soundly  that her voice only passed over him  and seemed like  the whistling of the wind among the fir trees.    Then poor Lily was led away  and forced to give up the golden dress  and  when she saw that there was no help for her  she went out into a meadow   and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of  the egg that the moon had given her  and when she broke it  there ran  out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold  that played about  and then  nestled under the old oneâ  s wings  so as to form the most beautiful  sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her  till the  bride saw them from her window  and was so pleased that she came forth  and asked her if she would sell the brood. â  Not for gold or silver  but  for flesh and blood  let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom  in his chamber  and I will give thee the whole brood.â      Then the princess thought to betray her as before  and agreed to  what she asked  but when the prince went to his chamber he asked  the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the  chamberlain told him all  how he had given him a sleeping draught  and  how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber  and was  to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the  sleeping draught  and when Lily came and began again to tell him what  woes had befallen her  and how faithful and true to him she had been   he knew his beloved wifeâ  s voice  and sprang up  and said  â  You have  awakened me as from a dream  for the strange princess had thrown a spell  around me  so that I had altogether forgotten you  but Heaven hath sent  you to me in a lucky hour.â      And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares  and seated  themselves on the griffin  who flew back with them over the Red Sea.  When they were half way across Lily let the nut fall into the water   and immediately a large nut tree arose from the sea  whereon the griffin  rested for a while  and then carried them safely home. There they found  their child  now grown up to be comely and fair  and after all their  troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.          THE FOX AND THE HORSE      A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to  him  but he was now grown too old to work  so the farmer would give him  nothing more to eat  and said  â  I want you no longer  so take yourself  off out of my stable  I shall not take you back again until you are  stronger than a lion.â   Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.    The poor horse was very melancholy  and wandered up and down in the  wood  seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently  a fox met him  â  Whatâ  s the matter  my friend â   said he  â  why do you hang  down your head and look so lonely and woe begone â   â  Ah â   replied the  horse  â  justice and avarice never dwell in one house  my master has  forgotten all that I have done for him so many years  and because I  can no longer work he has turned me adrift  and says unless I become  stronger than a lion he will not take me back again  what chance can I  have of that  he knows I have none  or he would not talk so.â      However  the fox bid him be of good cheer  and said  â  I will help you   lie down there  stretch yourself out quite stiff  and pretend to be  dead.â   The horse did as he was told  and the fox went straight to the  lion who lived in a cave close by  and said to him  â  A little way off  lies a dead horse  come with me and you may make an excellent meal of  his carcase.â   The lion was greatly pleased  and set off immediately  and  when they came to the horse  the fox said  â  You will not be able to eat  him comfortably here  Iâ  ll tell you what  I will tie you fast to  his tail  and then you can draw him to your den  and eat him at your  leisure.â      This advice pleased the lion  so he laid himself down quietly for the  fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs  together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he  could not set himself free. When the work was done  the fox clapped the  horse on the shoulder  and said  â  Jip  Dobbin  Jip â   Then up he sprang   and moved off  dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar  and bellow  till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright  but the  horse let him sing on  and made his way quietly over the fields to his  masterâ  s house.    â  Here he is  master â   said he  â  I have got the better of himâ    and when  the farmer saw his old servant  his heart relented  and he said. â  Thou  shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.â   And so the poor old  horse had plenty to eat  and lived  till he died.          THE BLUE LIGHT      There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the  king faithfully  but when the war came to an end could serve no longer  because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him   â  You may return to your home  I need you no longer  and you will not  receive any more money  for he only receives wages who renders me  service for them.â   Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living   went away greatly troubled  and walked the whole day  until in the  evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on  he saw a light   which he went up to  and came to a house wherein lived a witch. â  Do give  me one nightâ  s lodging  and a little to eat and drink â   said he to  her  â  or I shall starve.â   â  Oho â   she answered  â  who gives anything to a  run away soldier  Yet will I be compassionate  and take you in  if you  will do what I wish.â   â  What do you wish â   said the soldier. â  That you  should dig all round my garden for me  tomorrow.â   The soldier consented   and next day laboured with all his strength  but could not finish it by  the evening. â  I see well enough â   said the witch  â  that you can do no  more today  but I will keep you yet another night  in payment for  which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood  and chop it small.â   The  soldier spent the whole day in doing it  and in the evening the witch  proposed that he should stay one night more. â  Tomorrow  you shall only  do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house  there is an old  dry well  into which my light has fallen  it burns blue  and never goes  out  and you shall bring it up again.â   Next day the old woman took him  to the well  and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light  and  made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up  but when he  came near the edge  she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the  blue light away from him. â  No â   said he  perceiving her evil intention   â  I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon  the ground.â   The witch fell into a passion  let him fall again into the  well  and went away.    The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground  and the blue  light went on burning  but of what use was that to him  He saw very well  that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully   then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe  which  was still half full. â  This shall be my last pleasure â   thought he   pulled it out  lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the  smoke had circled about the cavern  suddenly a little black dwarf stood  before him  and said  â  Lord  what are your commands â   â  What my commands  are â   replied the soldier  quite astonished. â  I must do everything you  bid me â   said the little man. â  Good â   said the soldier  â  then in the  first place help me out of this well.â   The little man took him by the  hand  and led him through an underground passage  but he did not forget  to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the  treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there  and the  soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above  he said  to the little man  â  Now go and bind the old witch  and carry her before  the judge.â   In a short time she came by like the wind  riding on a wild  tom cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man  reappeared. â  It is all done â   said he  â  and the witch is already hanging  on the gallows. What further commands has my lord â   inquired the dwarf.  â  At this moment  none â   answered the soldier  â  you can return home  only  be at hand immediately  if I summon you.â   â  Nothing more is needed than  that you should light your pipe at the blue light  and I will appear  before you at once.â   Thereupon he vanished from his sight.    The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the  best inn  ordered himself handsome clothes  and then bade the landlord  furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the  soldier had taken possession of it  he summoned the little black manikin  and said  â  I have served the king faithfully  but he has dismissed me   and left me to hunger  and now I want to take my revenge.â   â  What am I to  do â   asked the little man. â  Late at night  when the kingâ  s daughter is  in bed  bring her here in her sleep  she shall do servantâ  s work for  me.â   The manikin said  â  That is an easy thing for me to do  but a very  dangerous thing for you  for if it is discovered  you will fare ill.â    When twelve oâ  clock had struck  the door sprang open  and the manikin  carried in the princess. â  Aha  are you there â   cried the soldier  â  get  to your work at once  Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.â   When  she had done this  he ordered her to come to his chair  and then he  stretched out his feet and said  â  Pull off my boots â   and then he  threw them in her face  and made her pick them up again  and clean  and brighten them. She  however  did everything he bade her  without  opposition  silently and with half shut eyes. When the first cock  crowed  the manikin carried her back to the royal palace  and laid her  in her bed.    Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father  and told  him that she had had a very strange dream. â  I was carried through the  streets with the rapidity of lightning â   said she  â  and taken into a  soldierâ  s room  and I had to wait upon him like a servant  sweep his  room  clean his boots  and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a  dream  and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.â    â  The dream may have been true â   said the king. â  I will give you a piece  of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas  and make a small hole in the  pocket  and then if you are carried away again  they will fall out and  leave a track in the streets.â   But unseen by the king  the manikin was  standing beside him when he said that  and heard all. At night when  the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets  some peas  certainly did fall out of her pocket  but they made no track  for the  crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there  was. And again the princess was compelled to do servantâ  s work until  cock crow.    Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track  but it was  all in vain  for in every street poor children were sitting  picking up  peas  and saying  â  It must have rained peas  last night.â   â  We must think  of something else â   said the king  â  keep your shoes on when you go to  bed  and before you come back from the place where you are taken  hide  one of them there  I will soon contrive to find it.â   The black manikin  heard this plot  and at night when the soldier again ordered him to  bring the princess  revealed it to him  and told him that he knew of no  expedient to counteract this stratagem  and that if the shoe were found  in the soldierâ  s house it would go badly with him. â  Do what I bid you â    replied the soldier  and again this third night the princess was obliged  to work like a servant  but before she went away  she hid her shoe under  the bed.    Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughterâ  s  shoe. It was found at the soldierâ  s  and the soldier himself  who at the  entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate  was soon brought back   and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable  things he had  the blue light and the gold  and had only one ducat in  his pocket. And now loaded with chains  he was standing at the window of  his dungeon  when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The  soldier tapped at the pane of glass  and when this man came up  said to  him  â  Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in  the inn  and I will give you a ducat for doing it.â   His comrade ran  thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone  again  he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. â  Have no  fear â   said the latter to his master. â  Go wheresoever they take you  and  let them do what they will  only take the blue light with you.â   Next day  the soldier was tried  and though he had done nothing wicked  the judge  condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die  he begged a last  favour of the king. â  What is it â   asked the king. â  That I may smoke one  more pipe on my way.â   â  You may smoke three â   answered the king  â  but do  not imagine that I will spare your life.â   Then the soldier pulled out  his pipe and lighted it at the blue light  and as soon as a few wreaths  of smoke had ascended  the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his  hand  and said  â  What does my lord command â   â  Strike down to earth that  false judge there  and his constable  and spare not the king who has  treated me so ill.â   Then the manikin fell on them like lightning   darting this way and that way  and whosoever was so much as touched by  his cudgel fell to earth  and did not venture to stir again. The king  was terrified  he threw himself on the soldierâ  s mercy  and merely to  be allowed to live at all  gave him his kingdom for his own  and his  daughter to wife.          THE RAVEN      There was once a queen who had a little daughter  still too young to run  alone. One day the child was very troublesome  and the mother could not  quiet it  do what she would. She grew impatient  and seeing the ravens  flying round the castle  she opened the window  and said  â  I wish you  were a raven and would fly away  then I should have a little peace.â    Scarcely were the words out of her mouth  when the child in her arms was  turned into a raven  and flew away from her through the open window. The  bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time   and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.    Long after this  a man was making his way through the wood when he heard  a raven calling  and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew  near  the raven said  â  I am by birth a kingâ  s daughter  but am now under  the spell of some enchantment  you can  however  set me free.â   â  What  am I to do â   he asked. She replied  â  Go farther into the wood until you  come to a house  wherein lives an old woman  she will offer you food and  drink  but you must not take of either  if you do  you will fall into  a deep sleep  and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the  house is a large tan heap  and on that you must stand and watch for me.  I shall drive there in my carriage at two oâ  clock in the afternoon for  three successive days  the first day it will be drawn by four white  the  second by four chestnut  and the last by four black horses  but if you  fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping  I shall not be set free.â      The man promised to do all that she wished  but the raven said  â  Alas  I  know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable  to save me.â   The man assured her again that he would on no account touch  a thing to eat or drink.    When he came to the house and went inside  the old woman met him  and  said  â  Poor man  how tired you are  Come in and rest and let me give you  something to eat and drink.â      â  No â   answered the man  â  I will neither eat not drink.â      But she would not leave him alone  and urged him saying  â  If you will  not eat anything  at least you might take a draught of wine  one drink  counts for nothing â   and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded  and  drank.    As it drew towards the appointed hour  he went outside into the garden  and mounted the tan heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of  fatigue came over him  and unable to resist it  he lay down for a little  while  fully determined  however  to keep awake  but in another minute  his eyes closed of their own accord  and he fell into such a deep sleep   that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two  oâ  clock the raven came driving along  drawn by her four white horses   but even before she reached the spot  she said to herself  sighing  â  I  know he has fallen asleep.â   When she entered the garden  there she found  him as she had feared  lying on the tan heap  fast asleep. She got out  of her carriage and went to him  she called him and shook him  but it  was all in vain  he still continued sleeping.    The next day at noon  the old woman came to him again with food and  drink which he at first refused. At last  overcome by her persistent  entreaties that he would take something  he lifted the glass and drank  again.    Towards two oâ  clock he went into the garden and on to the tan heap to  watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel  so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him  and he could  not stand upright any longer  so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.  As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses  she said sorrowfully  to herself  â  I know he has fallen asleep.â   She went as before to look  for him  but he slept  and it was impossible to awaken him.    The following day the old woman said to him  â  What is this  You are not  eating or drinking anything  do you want to kill yourself â      He answered  â  I may not and will not either eat or drink.â      But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him   and when he smelt the wine  he was unable to resist the temptation  and  took a deep draught.    When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan heap in  the garden to await the kingâ  s daughter  but he felt even more overcome  with weariness than on the two previous days  and throwing himself down   he slept like a log. At two oâ  clock the raven could be seen approaching   and this time her coachman and everything about her  as well as her  horses  were black.    She was sadder than ever as she drove along  and said mournfully  â  I  know he has fallen asleep  and will not be able to set me free.â   She  found him sleeping heavily  and all her efforts to awaken him were of no  avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf  and some meat  and a flask  of wine  of such a kind  that however much he took of them  they would  never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring  on which her name was  engraved  off her finger  and put it upon one of his. Finally  she laid  a letter near him  in which  after giving him particulars of the food  and drink she had left for him  she finished with the following words   â  I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me  free  if  however  you still wish to do so  come to the golden castle  of Stromberg  this is well within your power to accomplish.â   She then  returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.    When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping  he was grieved  at heart  and said  â  She has no doubt been here and driven away again   and it is now too late for me to save her.â   Then his eyes fell on the  things which were lying beside him  he read the letter  and knew from it  all that had happened. He rose up without delay  eager to start on his  way and to reach the castle of Stromberg  but he had no idea in which  direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it  and came at last to a dark forest  through which he went on walking for  fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night  came on  and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again  the next day he pursued his way through the forest  and that evening   thinking to rest again  he lay down as before  but he heard such a  howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till  it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses  and then  seeing a little glimmer ahead of him  he went towards it.    He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than  it really was  from the contrast of its height with that of an immense  giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself  â  If the giant  sees me going in  my life will not be worth much.â   However  after a  while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him   he called out  â  It is lucky for that you have come  for I have not had  anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.â   â  I  would rather you let that alone â   said the man  â  for I do not willingly  give myself up to be eaten  if you are wanting food I have enough to  satisfy your hunger.â   â  If that is so â   replied the giant  â  I will leave  you in peace  I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.â      So they went indoors together and sat down  and the man brought out the  bread  meat  and wine  which although he had eaten and drunk of them   were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer  and  ate and drank to his heartâ  s content. When he had finished his supper  the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.  The giant said  â  I will look on my map  on it are marked all the towns   villages  and houses.â   So he fetched his map  and looked for the castle   but could not find it. â  Never mind â   he said  â  I have larger maps  upstairs in the cupboard  we will look on those â   but they searched in  vain  for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought  he should like to continue his journey  but the giant begged him to  remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother  who was  away in search of provisions. When the brother came home  they asked him  about the castle of Stromberg  and he told them he would look on his own  maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly  when  he had finished his supper  they all went up together to his room and  looked through his maps  but the castle was not to be found. Then he  fetched other older maps  and they went on looking for the castle until  at last they found it  but it was many thousand miles away. â  How shall I  be able to get there â   asked the man. â  I have two hours to spare â   said  the giant  â  and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle  I  must then return to look after the child who is in our care.â      The giant  thereupon  carried the man to within about a hundred leagues  of the castle  where he left him  saying  â  You will be able to walk the  remainder of the way yourself.â   The man journeyed on day and night  till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated   however  on a glass mountain  and looking up from the foot he saw the  enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was  overjoyed to see her  and longed to get to the top of the mountain  but  the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he  fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her  he was  greatly grieved  and said to himself  â  I will remain here and wait for  her â   so he built himself a little hut  and there he sat and watched for  a whole year  and every day he saw the kingâ  s daughter driving round her  castle  but still was unable to get nearer to her.    Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he  called out to them  â  God be with you.â   They stopped when they heard the  call  but looking round and seeing nobody  they went on again with their  fighting  which now became more furious. â  God be with you â   he cried  again  and again they paused and looked about  but seeing no one went  back to their fighting. A third time he called out  â  God be with you â    and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between  the three men  he went out and asked them why they were fighting so  angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick   and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he  wished to pass  and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he  had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible  and the third had  caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle  and even  up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they  would keep together and have the things in common  or whether they would  separate. On hearing this  the man said  â  I will give you something in  exchange for those three things  not money  for that I have not got   but something that is of far more value. I must first  however  prove  whether all you have told me about your three things is true.â   The  robbers  therefore  made him get on the horse  and handed him the stick  and the cloak  and when he had put this round him he was no longer  visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after  another  crying  â  There  you idle vagabonds  you have got what you  deserve  are you satisfied now â      After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of  the castle  he found it closed  but he gave it a blow with his stick   and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the  steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting  with a golden  goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still  wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger   and threw it into the goblet  so that it rang as it touched the bottom.  â  That is my own ring â   she exclaimed  â  and if that is so the man must  also be here who is coming to set me free.â      She sought for him about the castle  but could find him nowhere.  Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off  the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him  and  cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms  and  she kissed him  and said  â  Now you have indeed set me free  and tomorrow  we will celebrate our marriage.â            THE GOLDEN GOOSE      There was a man who had three sons  the youngest of whom was called  Dummling     and was despised  mocked  and sneered at on every occasion.             Simpleton    It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood   and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a  bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.    When he entered the forest he met a little grey haired old man who bade  him good day  and said  â  Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket   and let me have a draught of your wine  I am so hungry and thirsty.â   But  the clever son answered  â  If I give you my cake and wine  I shall have  none for myself  be off with you â   and he left the little man standing  and went on.    But when he began to hew down a tree  it was not long before he made a  false stroke  and the axe cut him in the arm  so that he had to go home  and have it bound up. And this was the little grey manâ  s doing.    After this the second son went into the forest  and his mother gave him   like the eldest  a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man  met him likewise  and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.  But the second son  too  said sensibly enough  â  What I give you will be  taken away from myself  be off â   and he left the little man standing and  went on. His punishment  however  was not delayed  when he had made a  few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg  so that he had to be  carried home.    Then Dummling said  â  Father  do let me go and cut wood.â   The father  answered  â  Your brothers have hurt themselves with it  leave it alone   you do not understand anything about it.â   But Dummling begged so long  that at last he said  â  Just go then  you will get wiser by hurting  yourself.â   His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the  cinders  and with it a bottle of sour beer.    When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise   and greeting him  said  â  Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out  of your bottle  I am so hungry and thirsty.â   Dummling answered  â  I have  only cinder cake and sour beer  if that pleases you  we will sit  down and eat.â   So they sat down  and when Dummling pulled out his  cinder cake  it was a fine sweet cake  and the sour beer had become good  wine. So they ate and drank  and after that the little man said  â  Since  you have a good heart  and are willing to divide what you have  I will  give you good luck. There stands an old tree  cut it down  and you will  find something at the roots.â   Then the little man took leave of him.    Dummling went and cut down the tree  and when it fell there was a goose  sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up  and  taking her with him  went to an inn where he thought he would stay the  night. Now the host had three daughters  who saw the goose and were  curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be  and would have  liked to have one of its golden feathers.    The eldest thought  â  I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a  feather â   and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by  the wing  but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.    The second came soon afterwards  thinking only of how she might get a  feather for herself  but she had scarcely touched her sister than she  was held fast.    At last the third also came with the like intent  and the others  screamed out  â  Keep away  for goodnessâ   sake keep away â   But she did  not understand why she was to keep away. â  The others are there â   she  thought  â  I may as well be there too â   and ran to them  but as soon as  she had touched her sister  she remained sticking fast to her. So they  had to spend the night with the goose.    The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out   without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to  it. They were obliged to run after him continually  now left  now right   wherever his legs took him.    In the middle of the fields the parson met them  and when he saw the  procession he said  â  For shame  you good for nothing girls  why are you  running across the fields after this young man  Is that seemly â   At the  same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away   but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast  and was himself  obliged to run behind.    Before long the sexton came by and saw his master  the parson  running  behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out  â  Hi   your reverence  whither away so quickly  Do not forget that we have a  christening today â   and running after him he took him by the sleeve  but  was also held fast to it.    Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other  two labourers  came with their hoes from the fields  the parson called out to them  and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had  scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast  and now there were  seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.    Soon afterwards he came to a city  where a king ruled who had a daughter  who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth  a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry  her. When Dummling heard this  he went with his goose and all her train  before the kingâ  s daughter  and as soon as she saw the seven people  running on and on  one behind the other  she began to laugh quite  loudly  and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have  her for his wife  but the king did not like the son in law  and made all  manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink  a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man  who could  certainly help him  so he went into the forest  and in the same place  where he had felled the tree  he saw a man sitting  who had a very  sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so  sorely  and he answered  â  I have such a great thirst and cannot quench  it  cold water I cannot stand  a barrel of wine I have just emptied  but  that to me is like a drop on a hot stone â      â  There  I can help you â   said Dummling  â  just come with me and you shall  be satisfied.â      He led him into the kingâ  s cellar  and the man bent over the huge  barrels  and drank and drank till his loins hurt  and before the day was  out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more  for his bride  but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow  whom  everyone called Dummling  should take away his daughter  and he made a  new condition  he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain  of bread. Dummling did not think long  but went straight into the  forest  where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his  body with a strap  and making an awful face  and saying  â  I have eaten a  whole ovenful of rolls  but what good is that when one has such a hunger  as I  My stomach remains empty  and I must tie myself up if I am not to  die of hunger.â      At this Dummling was glad  and said  â  Get up and come with me  you shall  eat yourself full.â   He led him to the kingâ  s palace where all the  flour in the whole Kingdom was collected  and from it he caused a huge  mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it   began to eat  and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.  Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride  but the king again  sought a way out  and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on  water. â  As soon as you come sailing back in it â   said he  â  you shall  have my daughter for wife.â      Dummling went straight into the forest  and there sat the little grey  man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted   he said  â  Since you have given me to eat and to drink  I will give you  the ship  and I do all this because you once were kind to me.â   Then he  gave him the ship which could sail on land and water  and when the king  saw that  he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The  wedding was celebrated  and after the kingâ  s death  Dummling inherited  his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.          THE WATER OF LIFE      Long before you or I were born  there reigned  in a country a great way  off  a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill  so ill  that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved  at their fatherâ  s sickness  and as they were walking together very  mournfully in the garden of the palace  a little old man met them and  asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill   and that they were afraid nothing could save him. â  I know what would â    said the little old man  â  it is the Water of Life. If he could have a  draught of it he would be well again  but it is very hard to get.â   Then  the eldest son said  â  I will soon find itâ    and he went to the sick  king  and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life  as  it was the only thing that could save him. â  No â   said the king. â  I had  rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in  your journey.â   But he begged so hard that the king let him go  and the  prince thought to himself  â  If I bring my father this water  he will  make me sole heir to his kingdom.â      Then he set out  and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a  deep valley  overhung with rocks and woods  and as he looked around  he  saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf  with a  sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak  and the dwarf called to him and said   â  Prince  whither so fast â   â  What is that to thee  you ugly imp â   said  the prince haughtily  and rode on.    But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour  and laid a fairy spell  of ill luck upon him  so that as he rode on the mountain pass became  narrower and narrower  and at last the way was so straitened that he  could not go to step forward  and when he thought to have turned his  horse round and go back the way he came  he heard a loud laugh ringing  round him  and found that the path was closed behind him  so that he was  shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way  on foot  but again the laugh rang in his ears  and he found himself  unable to move a step  and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.    Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his sonâ  s  return  till at last the second son said  â  Father  I will go in search  of the Water of Life.â   For he thought to himself  â  My brother is surely  dead  and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.â   The king was  at first very unwilling to let him go  but at last yielded to his wish.  So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done   and met with the same elf  who stopped him at the same spot in the  mountains  saying  as before  â  Prince  prince  whither so fast â   â  Mind  your own affairs  busybody â   said the prince scornfully  and rode on.    But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder  brother  and he  too  was at last obliged to take up his abode in the  heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people  who think  themselves above everyone else  and are too proud to ask or take advice.    When the second prince had thus been gone a long time  the youngest son  said he would go and search for the Water of Life  and trusted he should  soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out  and the dwarf  met him too at the same spot in the valley  among the mountains  and  said  â  Prince  whither so fast â   And the prince said  â  I am going in  search of the Water of Life  because my father is ill  and like to die   can you help me  Pray be kind  and aid me if you can â   â  Do you know  where it is to be found â   asked the dwarf. â  No â   said the prince  â  I do  not. Pray tell me if you know.â   â  Then as you have spoken to me kindly   and are wise enough to seek for advice  I will tell you how and where to  go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle  and   that you may be able to reach it in safety  I will give you an iron wand  and two little loaves of bread  strike the iron door of the castle three  times with the wand  and it will open  two hungry lions will be lying  down inside gaping for their prey  but if you throw them the bread they  will let you pass  then hasten on to the well  and take some of the  Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve  for if you tarry longer  the door will shut upon you for ever.â      Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his  friendly aid  and took the wand and the bread  and went travelling on  and on  over sea and over land  till he came to his journeyâ  s end  and  found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at  the third stroke of the wand  and when the lions were quieted he went on  through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he  saw several knights sitting in a trance  then he pulled off their rings  and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a  sword and a loaf of bread  which he also took. Further on he came to a  room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch  and she welcomed him  joyfully  and said  if he would set her free from the spell that bound  her  the kingdom should be his  if he would come back in a year and  marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life  was in the palace gardens  and bade him make haste  and draw what he  wanted before the clock struck twelve.    He walked on  and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a  delightful shady spot in which stood a couch  and he thought to himself   as he felt tired  that he would rest himself for a while  and gaze on  the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down  and sleep  fell upon him unawares  so that he did not wake up till the clock was  striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully  frightened  ran to the well  filled a cup that was standing by him full  of water  and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of  the iron door it struck twelve  and the door fell so quickly upon him  that it snapped off a piece of his heel.    When he found himself safe  he was overjoyed to think that he had got  the Water of Life  and as he was going on his way homewards  he passed  by the little dwarf  who  when he saw the sword and the loaf  said  â  You  have made a noble prize  with the sword you can at a blow slay whole  armies  and the bread will never fail you.â   Then the prince thought  to himself  â  I cannot go home to my father without my brothersâ    so he  said  â  My dear friend  cannot you tell me where my two brothers are  who  set out in search of the Water of Life before me  and never came back â    â  I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains â   said the dwarf   â  because they were proud and ill behaved  and scorned to ask advice.â    The prince begged so hard for his brothers  that the dwarf at last set  them free  though unwillingly  saying  â  Beware of them  for they have  bad hearts.â   Their brother  however  was greatly rejoiced to see them   and told them all that had happened to him  how he had found the Water  of Life  and had taken a cup full of it  and how he had set a beautiful  princess free from a spell that bound her  and how she had engaged to  wait a whole year  and then to marry him  and to give him the kingdom.    Then they all three rode on together  and on their way home came to a  country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine  so that it was  feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land  the bread  and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the  wonderful sword  and he slew the enemyâ  s army with it  and thus the  kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he  befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.    When they came to the sea  they got into a ship and during their voyage  the two eldest said to themselves  â  Our brother has got the water which  we could not find  therefore our father will forsake us and give him the  kingdom  which is our rightâ    so they were full of envy and revenge  and  agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was  fast asleep  and poured the Water of Life out of the cup  and took it  for themselves  giving him bitter sea water instead.    When they came to their journeyâ  s end  the youngest son brought his cup  to the sick king  that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely  however   had he tasted the bitter sea water when he became worse even than he was  before  and then both the elder sons came in  and blamed the youngest  for what they had done  and said that he wanted to poison their father   but that they had found the Water of Life  and had brought it with them.  He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him  than he felt his  sickness leave him  and was as strong and well as in his younger days.  Then they went to their brother  and laughed at him  and said  â  Well   brother  you found the Water of Life  did you  You have had the trouble  and we shall have the reward. Pray  with all your cleverness  why did  not you manage to keep your eyes open  Next year one of us will take  away your beautiful princess  if you do not take care. You had better  say nothing about this to our father  for he does not believe a word you  say  and if you tell tales  you shall lose your life into the bargain   but be quiet  and we will let you off.â      The old king was still very angry with his youngest son  and thought  that he really meant to have taken away his life  so he called his court  together  and asked what should be done  and all agreed that he ought to  be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on  till one  day  when the kingâ  s chief huntsmen went a hunting with him  and they  were alone in the wood together  the huntsman looked so sorrowful that  the prince said  â  My friend  what is the matter with you â   â  I cannot and  dare not tell you â   said he. But the prince begged very hard  and said   â  Only tell me what it is  and do not think I shall be angry  for I will  forgive you.â   â  Alas â   said the huntsman  â  the king has ordered me to  shoot you.â   The prince started at this  and said  â  Let me live  and I  will change dresses with you  you shall take my royal coat to show to my  father  and do you give me your shabby one.â   â  With all my heart â   said  the huntsman  â  I am sure I shall be glad to save you  for I could not  have shot you.â   Then he took the princeâ  s coat  and gave him the shabby  one  and went away through the wood.    Some time after  three grand embassies came to the old kingâ  s court   with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son  now  all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword  and loaf of bread  in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their  people. This touched the old kingâ  s heart  and he thought his son might  still be guiltless  and said to his court  â  O that my son were still  alive  how it grieves me that I had him killed â   â  He is still alive â    said the huntsman  â  and I am glad that I had pity on him  but let him  go in peace  and brought home his royal coat.â   At this the king was  overwhelmed with joy  and made it known throughout all his kingdom  that  if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.    Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should  come back  and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining  gold  and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback  and rode  straight up to the gate upon it  was her true lover  and that they must  let him in  but whoever rode on one side of it  they must be sure was  not the right one  and that they must send him away at once.    The time soon came  when the eldest brother thought that he would make  haste to go to the princess  and say that he was the one who had set  her free  and that he should have her for his wife  and the kingdom with  her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road  he stopped to  look at it  and he thought to himself  â  It is a pity to ride upon this  beautiful roadâ    so he turned aside and rode on the right hand side of  it. But when he came to the gate  the guards  who had seen the road  he took  said to him  he could not be what he said he was  and must go  about his business.    The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand  and when  he came to the golden road  and his horse had set one foot upon it   he stopped to look at it  and thought it very beautiful  and said to  himself  â  What a pity it is that anything should tread here â   Then he  too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to  the gate the guards said he was not the true prince  and that he too  must go away about his business  and away he went.    Now when the full year was come round  the third brother left the forest  in which he had lain hid for fear of his fatherâ  s anger  and set out in  search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on  thinking of her all  the way  and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was  made of  but went with his horse straight over it  and as he came to the  gate it flew open  and the princess welcomed him with joy  and said  he was her deliverer  and should now be her husband and lord of the  kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over  the princess told  him she had heard of his father having forgiven him  and of his wish to  have him home again  so  before his wedding with the princess  he went  to visit his father  taking her with him. Then he told him everything   how his brothers had cheated and robbed him  and yet that he had borne  all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very  angry  and wanted to punish his wicked sons  but they made their escape   and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea  and where they  went to nobody knew and nobody cared.    And now the old king gathered together his court  and asked all his  kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.  And young and old  noble and squire  gentle and simple  came at once  on the summons  and among the rest came the friendly dwarf  with the  sugarloaf hat  and a new scarlet cloak.      And the wedding was held  and the merry bells run.    And all the good people they danced and they sung     And feasted and frolickâ  d I canâ  t tell how long.          THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN      There was once a kingâ  s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And  when he was sitting beside her and very happy  news came that his father  lay sick unto death  and desired to see him once again before his end.  Then he said to his beloved  â  I must now go and leave you  I give you  a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king  I will return and fetch  you.â   So he rode away  and when he reached his father  the latter was  dangerously ill  and near his death. He said to him  â  Dear son  I wished  to see you once again before my end  promise me to marry as I wish â   and  he named a certain kingâ  s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was  in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing  and said  â  Yes   dear father  your will shall be done â   and thereupon the king shut his  eyes  and died.    When therefore the son had been proclaimed king  and the time of  mourning was over  he was forced to keep the promise which he had given  his father  and caused the kingâ  s daughter to be asked in marriage  and  she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this  and fretted  so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father  said to her  â  Dearest child  why are you so sad  You shall have  whatsoever you will.â   She thought for a moment and said  â  Dear father   I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face  figure  and size.â    The father said  â  If it be possible  your desire shall be fulfilled â    and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom  until eleven  young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face   figure  and size.    When they came to the kingâ  s daughter  she had twelve suits of  huntsmenâ  s clothes made  all alike  and the eleven maidens had to put  on the huntsmenâ  s clothes  and she herself put on the twelfth suit.  Thereupon she took her leave of her father  and rode away with them   and rode to the court of her former betrothed  whom she loved so dearly.  Then she asked if he required any huntsmen  and if he would take all of  them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her  but  as they were such handsome fellows  he said  â  Yes â   and that he would  willingly take them  and now they were the kingâ  s twelve huntsmen.    The king  however  had a lion which was a wondrous animal  for he knew  all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he  said to the king  â  You think you have twelve huntsmen â   â  Yes â   said the  king  â  they are twelve huntsmen.â   The lion continued  â  You are mistaken   they are twelve girls.â   The king said  â  That cannot be true  How  will you prove that to me â   â  Oh  just let some peas be strewn in the  ante chamber â   answered the lion  â  and then you will soon see. Men have  a firm step  and when they walk over peas none of them stir  but girls  trip and skip  and drag their feet  and the peas roll about.â   The king  was well pleased with the counsel  and caused the peas to be strewn.    There was  however  a servant of the kingâ  s who favoured the huntsmen   and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to  them and repeated everything  and said  â  The lion wants to make the king  believe that you are girls.â   Then the kingâ  s daughter thanked him  and  said to her maidens  â  Show some strength  and step firmly on the peas.â    So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before  him  and they came into the ante chamber where the peas were lying  they  stepped so firmly on them  and had such a strong  sure walk  that not  one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again   and the king said to the lion  â  You have lied to me  they walk just like  men.â   The lion said  â  They have been informed that they were going to  be put to the test  and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve  spinning wheels be brought into the ante chamber  and they will go to  them and be pleased with them  and that is what no man would do.â    The king liked the advice  and had the spinning wheels placed in the  ante chamber.    But the servant  who was well disposed to the huntsmen  went to them   and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the kingâ  s daughter  said to her eleven girls  â  Show some constraint  and do not look round  at the spinning wheels.â   And next morning when the king had his twelve  huntsmen summoned  they went through the ante chamber  and never once  looked at the spinning wheels. Then the king again said to the lion   â  You have deceived me  they are men  for they have not looked at the  spinning wheels.â   The lion replied  â  They have restrained themselves.â    The king  however  would no longer believe the lion.    The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase  and his  liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that  once when they were out hunting  news came that the kingâ  s bride was  approaching. When the true bride heard that  it hurt her so much that  her heart was almost broken  and she fell fainting to the ground. The  king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman  ran up to him   wanted to help him  and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which  he had given to his first bride  and when he looked in her face he  recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her  and  when she opened her eyes he said  â  You are mine  and I am yours  and  no one in the world can alter that.â   He sent a messenger to the other  bride  and entreated her to return to her own kingdom  for he had a wife  already  and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new  one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated  and the lion was again taken  into favour  because  after all  he had told the truth.          THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN      There was once a merchant who had only one child  a son  that was very  young  and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then  making a voyage upon the seas  in which he had embarked all his wealth   in the hope of making great gains  when the news came that both were  lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that  nothing was left to him but one small plot of land  and there he often  went in an evening to take his walk  and ease his mind of a little of  his trouble.    One day  as he was roaming along in a brown study  thinking with no  great comfort on what he had been and what he now was  and was like  to be  all on a sudden there stood before him a little  rough looking   black dwarf. â  Prithee  friend  why so sorrowful â   said he to the  merchant  â  what is it you take so deeply to heart â   â  If you would do me  any good I would willingly tell you â   said the merchant. â  Who knows but  I may â   said the little man  â  tell me what ails you  and perhaps you  will find I may be of some use.â   Then the merchant told him how all his  wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea  and how he had nothing left  but that little plot of land. â  Oh  trouble not yourself about that â    said the dwarf  â  only undertake to bring me here  twelve years hence   whatever meets you first on your going home  and I will give you as much  as you please.â   The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask   that it would most likely be his dog or his cat  or something of that  sort  but forgot his little boy Heinel  so he agreed to the bargain  and  signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.    But as he drew near home  his little boy was so glad to see him that he  crept behind him  and laid fast hold of his legs  and looked up in  his face and laughed. Then the father started  trembling with fear and  horror  and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do  but as no  gold was come  he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke  that the dwarf was playing him  and that  at any rate  when the money  came  he should see the bearer  and would not take it in.    About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber room to look  for some old iron  that he might sell it and raise a little money  and  there  instead of his iron  he saw a large pile of gold lying on the  floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed  and forgetting all about  his son  went into trade again  and became a richer merchant than  before.    Meantime little Heinel grew up  and as the end of the twelve years drew  near the merchant began to call to mind his bond  and became very sad  and thoughtful  so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The  boy one day asked what was the matter  but his father would not tell for  some time  at last  however  he said that he had  without knowing it   sold him for gold to a little  ugly looking  black dwarf  and that the  twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel  said  â  Father  give yourself very little trouble about that  I shall be  too much for the little man.â      When the time came  the father and son went out together to the place  agreed upon  and the son drew a circle on the ground  and set himself  and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came   and walked round and round about the circle  but could not find any way  to get into it  and he either could not  or dared not  jump over it. At  last the boy said to him. â  Have you anything to say to us  my friend  or  what do you want â   Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy  that  was fond of him  and had told him what to do  for this fairy knew what  good luck was in store for him. â  Have you brought me what you said you  would â   said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue  but  Heinel said again  â  What do you want here â   The dwarf said  â  I come to  talk with your father  not with you.â   â  You have cheated and taken in my  father â   said the son  â  pray give him up his bond at once.â   â  Fair and  softly â   said the little old man  â  right is right  I have paid my money   and your father has had it  and spent it  so be so good as to let me  have what I paid it for.â   â  You must have my consent to that first â   said  Heinel  â  so please to step in here  and let us talk it over.â   The old  man grinned  and showed his teeth  as if he should have been very glad  to get into the circle if he could. Then at last  after a long talk   they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up  and  that so far the dwarf should have his way  but  on the other hand  the  fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him  if he followed  his own course  and he did not choose to be given up to his hump backed  friend  who seemed so anxious for his company.    So  to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter  it was settled that  Heinel should be put into an open boat  that lay on the sea shore hard  by  that the father should push him off with his own hand  and that he  should thus be set adrift  and left to the bad or good luck of wind and  weather. Then he took leave of his father  and set himself in the boat   but before it got far off a wave struck it  and it fell with one side  low in the water  so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost  and  went home very sorrowful  while the dwarf went his way  thinking that at  any rate he had had his revenge.    The boat  however  did not sink  for the good fairy took care of her  friend  and soon raised the boat up again  and it went safely on. The  young man sat safe within  till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown  land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle  but empty and dreary within  for it was enchanted. â  Here â   said he to  himself  â  must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.â   So he once  more searched the whole palace through  till at last he found a white  snake  lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.    Now the white snake was an enchanted princess  and she was very glad  to see him  and said  â  Are you at last come to set me free  Twelve  long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she  promised  for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come   their faces will be black  and they will be dressed in chain armour.  They will ask what you do here  but give no answer  and let them do  what they will  beat  whip  pinch  prick  or torment you  bear all  only  speak not a word  and at twelve oâ  clock they must go away. The second  night twelve others will come  and the third night twenty four  who  will even cut off your head  but at the twelfth hour of that night their  power is gone  and I shall be free  and will come and bring you the  Water of Life  and will wash you with it  and bring you back to life  and health.â   And all came to pass as she had said  Heinel bore all  and  spoke not a word  and the third night the princess came  and fell on his  neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle   the wedding was celebrated  and he was crowned king of the Golden  Mountain.    They lived together very happily  and the queen had a son. And thus  eight years had passed over their heads  when the king thought of his  father  and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was  against his going  and said  â  I know well that misfortunes will come  upon us if you go.â   However  he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his  going away she gave him a wishing ring  and said  â  Take this ring  and  put it on your finger  whatever you wish it will bring you  only promise  never to make use of it to bring me hence to your fatherâ  s house.â   Then  he said he would do what she asked  and put the ring on his finger  and  wished himself near the town where his father lived.    Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment  but the guards would  not let him go in  because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a  neighbouring hill  where a shepherd dwelt  and borrowed his old frock   and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his fatherâ  s  house  he said he was his son  but the merchant would not believe him   and said he had had but one son  his poor Heinel  who he knew was long  since dead  and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd  he would  not even give him anything to eat. The king  however  still vowed that  he was his son  and said  â  Is there no mark by which you would know me  if I am really your son â   â  Yes â   said his mother  â  our Heinel had a mark  like a raspberry on his right arm.â   Then he showed them the mark  and  they knew that what he had said was true.    He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain  and was  married to a princess  and had a son seven years old. But the merchant  said  â  that can never be true  he must be a fine king truly who travels  about in a shepherdâ  s frock â   At this the son was vexed  and forgetting  his word  turned his ring  and wished for his queen and son. In an  instant they stood before him  but the queen wept  and said he had  broken his word  and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to  soothe her  and she at last seemed to be appeased  but she was not so in  truth  and was only thinking how she should punish him.    One day he took her to walk with him out of the town  and showed her  the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat  himself down  and said  â  I am very much tired  sit by me  I will rest my  head in your lap  and sleep a while.â   As soon as he had fallen asleep   however  she drew the ring from his finger  and crept softly away  and  wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke  he found himself alone  and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.  â  I can never go back to my fatherâ  s house â   said he  â  they would say I  am a sorcerer  I will journey forth into the world  till I come again to  my kingdom.â      So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill  where three  giants were sharing their fatherâ  s goods  and as they saw him pass they  cried out and said  â  Little men have sharp wits  he shall part the goods  between us.â   Now there was a sword that cut off an enemyâ  s head whenever  the wearer gave the words  â  Heads off â    a cloak that made the owner  invisible  or gave him any form he pleased  and a pair of boots that  carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let  him try these wonderful things  then he might know how to set a value  upon them. Then they gave him the cloak  and he wished himself a fly   and in a moment he was a fly. â  The cloak is very well â   said he  â  now  give me the sword.â   â  No â   said they  â  not unless you undertake not to  say  â  Heads off â   for if you do we are all dead men.â   So they gave it  him  charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also   and the moment he had all three in his power  he wished himself at  the Golden Mountain  and there he was at once. So the giants were left  behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.    As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music  and  the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another  husband. Then he threw his cloak around him  and passed through the  castle hall  and placed himself by the side of the queen  where no one  saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate  he took it  away and ate it himself  and when a glass of wine was handed to her  he  took it and drank it  and thus  though they kept on giving her meat and  drink  her plate and cup were always empty.    Upon this  fear and remorse came over her  and she went into her chamber  alone  and sat there weeping  and he followed her there. â  Alas â   said  she to herself  â  was I not once set free  Why then does this enchantment  still seem to bind me â      â  False and fickle one â   said he. â  One indeed came who set thee free  and  he is now near thee again  but how have you used him  Ought he to  have had such treatment from thee â   Then he went out and sent away the  company  and said the wedding was at an end  for that he was come back  to the kingdom. But the princes  peers  and great men mocked at him.  However  he would enter into no parley with them  but only asked them  if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried  to seize him  but he drew his sword. â  Heads Off â   cried he  and with the  word the traitorsâ   heads fell before him  and Heinel was once more king  of the Golden Mountain.          DOCTOR KNOWALL      There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb  who drove with  two oxen a load of wood to the town  and sold it to a doctor for two  talers. When the money was being counted out to him  it so happened that  the doctor was sitting at table  and when the peasant saw how well he  ate and drank  his heart desired what he saw  and would willingly  have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while  and at length  inquired if he too could not be a doctor. â  Oh  yes â   said the doctor   â  that is soon managed.â   â  What must I do â   asked the peasant. â  In the  first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on  the frontispiece  in the second  turn your cart and your two oxen into  money  and get yourself some clothes  and whatsoever else pertains to  medicine  thirdly  have a sign painted for yourself with the words  â  I  am Doctor Knowall â   and have that nailed up above your house door.â   The  peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored  people awhile  but not long  a rich and great lord had some money  stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such  a village  and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had  the horses harnessed to his carriage  drove out to the village  and  asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes  he was  he said. Then he was  to go with him and bring back the stolen money. â  Oh  yes  but Grete  my  wife  must go too.â   The lord was willing  and let both of them have a  seat in the carriage  and they all drove away together. When they came  to the noblemanâ  s castle  the table was spread  and Crabb was told to  sit down and eat. â  Yes  but my wife  Grete  too â   said he  and he seated  himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a  dish of delicate fare  the peasant nudged his wife  and said  â  Grete   that was the first â   meaning that was the servant who brought the first  dish. The servant  however  thought he intended by that to say  â  That is  the first thief â   and as he actually was so  he was terrified  and said  to his comrade outside  â  The doctor knows all  we shall fare ill  he  said I was the first.â   The second did not want to go in at all  but was  forced. So when he went in with his dish  the peasant nudged his wife   and said  â  Grete  that is the second.â   This servant was equally alarmed   and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better  for the  peasant again said  â  Grete  that is the third.â   The fourth had to carry  in a dish that was covered  and the lord told the doctor that he was to  show his skill  and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually  there  were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish  had no idea what to say  and  cried  â  Ah  poor Crabb.â   When the lord heard that  he cried  â  There  he  knows it  he must also know who has the money â      On this the servants looked terribly uneasy  and made a sign to the  doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore  he went out  all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen  the money  and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a  heavy sum into the bargain  if he would not denounce them  for if he  did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was  concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied  and returned to the hall   sat down to the table  and said  â  My lord  now will I search in my book  where the gold is hidden.â   The fifth servant  however  crept into the  stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still  and opened his A B C book  turned the pages backwards and forwards  and  looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said  â  I  know you are there  so you had better come out â   Then the fellow in the  stove thought that the doctor meant him  and full of terror  sprang out   crying  â  That man knows everything â   Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord  where the money was  but did not say who had stolen it  and received  from both sides much money in reward  and became a renowned man.          THE SEVEN RAVENS      There was once a man who had seven sons  and last of all one daughter.  Although the little girl was very pretty  she was so weak and small that  they thought she could not live  but they said she should at once be  christened.    So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some  water  but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at  drawing the water  and so they were in such a hurry that all let their  pitchers fall into the well  and they stood very foolishly looking at  one another  and did not know what to do  for none dared go home. In the  meantime the father was uneasy  and could not tell what made the  young men stay so long. â  Surely â   said he  â  the whole seven must have  forgotten themselves over some game of playâ    and when he had waited  still longer and they yet did not come  he flew into a rage and wished  them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he  heard a croaking over his head  and looked up and saw seven ravens as  black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish  so fulfilled  he did not know how what was done could be undone  and  comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons  with his dear little daughter  who soon became stronger and every day  more beautiful.    For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers  for  her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her  but one  day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. â  Yes â   said  they  â  she is beautiful indeed  but still â  tis a pity that her brothers  should have been lost for her sake.â   Then she was much grieved  and went  to her father and mother  and asked if she had any brothers  and what  had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her  but  said it was the will of Heaven  and that her birth was only the innocent  cause of it  but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day  and  thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back   and she had neither rest nor ease  till at length one day she stole  away  and set out into the wide world to find her brothers  wherever  they might be  and free them  whatever it might cost her.    She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother  had given her  a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry  a little  pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty  and a little stool  to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on  and  journeyed till she came to the worldâ  s end  then she came to the sun   but the sun looked much too hot and fiery  so she ran away quickly to  the moon  but the moon was cold and chilly  and said  â  I smell flesh  and blood this way â   so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the  stars  and the stars were friendly and kind to her  and each star sat  upon his own little stool  but the morning star rose up and gave her a  little piece of wood  and said  â  If you have not this little piece of  wood  you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass mountain   and there your brothers live.â   The little girl took the piece of wood   rolled it up in a little cloth  and went on again until she came to the  glass mountain  and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little  piece of wood  but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there  and  she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done   She wanted to save her brothers  and had no key of the castle of the  glass mountain  so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her  pocket and cut off her little finger  that was just the size of the  piece of wood she had lost  and put it in the door and opened it.    As she went in  a little dwarf came up to her  and said  â  What are you  seeking for â   â  I seek for my brothers  the seven ravens â   answered she.  Then the dwarf said  â  My masters are not at home  but if you will wait  till they come  pray step in.â   Now the little dwarf was getting their  dinner ready  and he brought their food upon seven little plates  and  their drink in seven little glasses  and set them upon the table  and  out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece  and out of each  little glass she drank a small drop  but she let the ring that she had  brought with her fall into the last glass.    On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air  and the  dwarf said  â  Here come my masters.â   When they came in  they wanted to  eat and drink  and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said  one after the other     â  Who has eaten from my little plate  And who has been drinking out of my  little glass â       â  Caw  Caw  well I ween    Mortal lips have this way been.â      When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass  and found there the  ring  he looked at it  and knew that it was his fatherâ  s and motherâ  s   and said  â  O that our little sister would but come  then we should be  free.â   When the little girl heard this  for she stood behind the door  all the time and listened   she ran forward  and in an instant all  the ravens took their right form again  and all hugged and kissed each  other  and went merrily home.          THE WEDDING OF MRS FOX      FIRST STORY    There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails  who believed that  his wife was not faithful to him  and wished to put her to the test. He  stretched himself out under the bench  did not move a limb  and behaved  as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room  shut herself in   and her maid  Miss Cat  sat by the fire  and did the cooking. When it  became known that the old fox was dead  suitors presented themselves.  The maid heard someone standing at the house door  knocking. She went  and opened it  and it was a young fox  who said      â  What may you be about  Miss Cat     Do you sleep or do you wake â      She answered      â  I am not sleeping  I am waking     Would you know what I am making     I am boiling warm beer with butter     Will you be my guest for supper â      â  No  thank you  miss â   said the fox  â  what is Mrs Fox doing â   The maid  replied      â  She is sitting in her room     Moaning in her gloom     Weeping her little eyes quite red     Because old Mr Fox is dead.â      â  Do just tell her  miss  that a young fox is here  who would like to woo  her.â   â  Certainly  young sir.â        The cat goes up the stairs trip  trap     The door she knocks at tap  tap  tap    â  Mistress Fox  are you inside â     â  Oh  yes  my little cat â   she cried.   â  A wooer he stands at the door out there.â     â  What does he look like  my dear â      â  Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox â   â  Oh  no â   answered  the cat  â  he has only one.â   â  Then I will not have him.â      Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there  was another knock  and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs  Fox. He had two tails  but he did not fare better than the first. After  this still more came  each with one tail more than the other  but they  were all turned away  until at last one came who had nine tails  like  old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that  she said joyfully to the cat      â  Now open the gates and doors all wide     And carry old Mr Fox outside.â      But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized  old Mr Fox stirred  under the bench  and cudgelled all the rabble  and drove them and Mrs  Fox out of the house.      SECOND STORY    When old Mr Fox was dead  the wolf came as a suitor  and knocked at the  door  and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox  opened it for him. The  wolf greeted her  and said      â  Good day  Mrs Cat of Kehrewit     How comes it that alone you sit     What are you making good â      The cat replied      â  In milk Iâ  m breaking bread so sweet     Will you be my guest  and eat â      â  No  thank you  Mrs Cat â   answered the wolf. â  Is Mrs Fox not at home â      The cat said      â  She sits upstairs in her room     Bewailing her sorrowful doom     Bewailing her trouble so sore     For old Mr Fox is no more.â      The wolf answered      â  If sheâ  s in want of a husband now     Then will it please her to step below â      The cat runs quickly up the stair     And lets her tail fly here and there     Until she comes to the parlour door.    With her five gold rings at the door she knocks    â  Are you within  good Mistress Fox     If youâ  re in want of a husband now     Then will it please you to step below     Mrs Fox asked  â  Has the gentleman red stockings on  and has he a pointed  mouth â   â  No â   answered the cat. â  Then he wonâ  t do for me.â      When the wolf was gone  came a dog  a stag  a hare  a bear  a lion  and  all the beasts of the forest  one after the other. But one of the good  qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed  was always lacking  and the  cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young  fox. Then Mrs Fox said  â  Has the gentleman red stockings on  and has a  little pointed mouth â   â  Yes â   said the cat  â  he has.â   â  Then let him come  upstairs â   said Mrs Fox  and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding  feast.     â  Sweep me the room as clean as you can     Up with the window  fling out my old man     For many a fine fat mouse he brought     Yet of his wife he never thought     But ate up every one he caught.â      Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox  and there was much  rejoicing and dancing  and if they have not left off  they are dancing  still.          THE SALAD      As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood   there came up a little old woman  and said to him  â  Good day  good day   you seem merry enough  but I am hungry and thirsty  do pray give me  something to eat.â   The huntsman took pity on her  and put his hand in  his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way  but  she took hold of him  and said  â  Listen  my friend  to what I am going  to tell you  I will reward you for your kindness  go your way  and after  a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds  sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them  and one will fall down  dead  the cloak will fall too  take it  it is a wishing cloak  and when  you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to  be. Cut open the dead bird  take out its heart and keep it  and you will  find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It  is the birdâ  s heart that will bring you this good luck.â      The huntsman thanked her  and thought to himself  â  If all this does  happen  it will be a fine thing for me.â   When he had gone a hundred  steps or so  he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him   and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills  and feet  screaming  fighting  and tugging at each other as if  each wished to have it himself. â  Well â   said the huntsman  â  this is  wonderful  this happens just as the old woman saidâ    then he shot into  the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the  flock chattering away  but one fell down dead  and the cloak with it.  Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him  cut open the bird  took  out the heart  and carried the cloak home with him.    The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow  and there lay  the piece of gold glittering underneath  the same happened next day  and  indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold  and  at last thought to himself  â  Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am  at home  I will go out into the world and look about me.â      Then he took leave of his friends  and hung his bag and bow about his  neck  and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through  a thick wood  at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow   and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young  lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch  and  said to the young lady  â  There is a young man coming out of the wood who  carries a wonderful prize  we must get it away from him  my dear child   for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a birdâ  s heart that  brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.â   Meantime the  huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady  and said to himself  â  I  have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle  and rest myself  for I have money enough to pay for anything I wantâ     but the real reason was  that he wanted to see more of the beautiful  lady. Then he went into the house  and was welcomed kindly  and it was  not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else  but looking at the ladyâ  s eyes  and doing everything that she wished.  Then the old woman said  â  Now is the time for getting the birdâ  s heart.â    So the lady stole it away  and he never found any more gold under his  pillow  for it lay now under the young ladyâ  s  and the old woman took it  away every morning  but he was so much in love that he never missed his  prize.    â  Well â   said the old witch  â  we have got the birdâ  s heart  but not the  wishing cloak yet  and that we must also get.â   â  Let us leave him that â    said the young lady  â  he has already lost his wealth.â   Then the witch  was very angry  and said  â  Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful  thing  and I must and will have it.â   So she did as the old woman told  her  and set herself at the window  and looked about the country and  seemed very sorrowful  then the huntsman said  â  What makes you so sad â    â  Alas  dear sir â   said she  â  yonder lies the granite rock where all the  costly diamonds grow  and I want so much to go there  that whenever I  think of it I cannot help being sorrowful  for who can reach it  only  the birds and the flies  man cannot.â   â  If thatâ  s all your grief â   said  the huntsman  â  Iâ  ll take you there with all my heartâ    so he drew her under  his cloak  and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they  were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were  delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch  made a deep sleep come upon him  and he said to the young lady  â  Let us  sit down and rest ourselves a little  I am so tired that I cannot stand  any longer.â   So they sat down  and he laid his head in her lap and  fell asleep  and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from  his shoulders  hung it on her own  picked up the diamonds  and wished  herself home again.    When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him  and left him  alone on the wild rock  he said  â  Alas  what roguery there is in the  world â   and there he sat in great grief and fear  not knowing what to  do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it  and as  he saw three of them striding about  he thought to himself  â  I can only  save myself by feigning to be asleepâ    so he laid himself down as if he  were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him  the first pushed  him with his foot  and said  â  What worm is this that lies here curled  up â   â  Tread upon him and kill him â   said the second. â  Itâ  s not worth the  trouble â   said the third  â  let him live  heâ  ll go climbing higher up the  mountain  and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.â   And they  passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said  and as soon as they  were gone  he climbed to the top of the mountain  and when he had sat  there a short time a cloud came rolling around him  and caught him in a  whirlwind and bore him along for some time  till it settled in a garden   and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.    Then he looked around him  and said  â  I wish I had something to eat  if  not I shall be worse off than before  for here I see neither apples  nor pears  nor any kind of fruits  nothing but vegetables.â   At last he  thought to himself  â  I can eat salad  it will refresh and strengthen  me.â   So he picked out a fine head and ate of it  but scarcely had he  swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed  and saw with  horror that he was turned into an ass. However  he still felt very  hungry  and the salad tasted very nice  so he ate on till he came  to another kind of salad  and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt  another change come over him  and soon saw that he was lucky enough to  have found his old shape again.    Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness  and  when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and  the bad salad  and thought to himself  â  This will help me to my fortune  again  and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.â   So he  went away to try and find the castle of his friends  and after wandering  about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over  brown  so that even his mother would not have known him  and went into  the castle and asked for a lodging  â  I am so tired â   said he  â  that I  can go no farther.â   â  Countryman â   said the witch  â  who are you  and what  is your business â   â  I am â   said he  â  a messenger sent by the king to  find the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky  enough to find it  and have brought it with me  but the heat of the sun  scorches so that it begins to wither  and I donâ  t know that I can carry  it farther.â      When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad  they  longed to taste it  and said  â  Dear countryman  let us just taste it.â    â  To be sure â   answered he  â  I have two heads of it with me  and will  give you oneâ    so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the  witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed  and when it was  ready she could not wait till it was carried up  but took a few leaves  immediately and put them in her mouth  and scarcely were they swallowed  when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the  form of an ass. Now the servant maid came into the kitchen  and seeing  the salad ready  was going to carry it up  but on the way she too felt a  wish to taste it as the old woman had done  and ate some leaves  so she  also was turned into an ass and ran after the other  letting the dish  with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with  the beautiful young lady  and as nobody came with the salad and she  longed to taste it  she said  â  I donâ  t know where the salad can be.â    Then he thought something must have happened  and said  â  I will go  into the kitchen and see.â   And as he went he saw two asses in the court  running about  and the salad lying on the ground. â  All right â   said  he  â  those two have had their share.â   Then he took up the rest of  the leaves  laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady   saying  â  I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.â    So she ate of it  and like the others ran off into the court braying  away.    Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they  might know him. â  Now you shall be paid for your roguery â   said he  and  tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he  came to a mill and knocked at the window. â  Whatâ  s the matter â   said the  miller. â  I have three tiresome beasts here â   said the other  â  if you  will take them  give them food and room  and treat them as I tell you   I will pay you whatever you ask.â   â  With all my heart â   said the miller   â  but how shall I treat them â   Then the huntsman said  â  Give the old  one stripes three times a day and hay once  give the next  who was  the servant maid  stripes once a day and hay three times  and give  the youngest  who was the beautiful lady  hay three times a day and  no stripesâ    for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.  After this he went back to the castle  where he found everything he  wanted.    Some days after  the miller came to him and told him that the old ass  was dead  â  The other two â   said he  â  are alive and eat  but are so  sorrowful that they cannot last long.â   Then the huntsman pitied them   and told the miller to drive them back to him  and when they came  he  gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady  fell upon her knees before him  and said  â  O dearest huntsman  forgive  me all the ill I have done you  my mother forced me to it  it was  against my will  for I always loved you very much. Your wishing cloak  hangs up in the closet  and as for the birdâ  s heart  I will give it you  too.â   But he said  â  Keep it  it will be just the same thing  for I mean  to make you my wife.â   So they were married  and lived together very  happily till they died.          THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS      A certain father had two sons  the elder of who was smart and sensible   and could do everything  but the younger was stupid and could neither  learn nor understand anything  and when people saw him they said   â  Thereâ  s a fellow who will give his father some trouble â   When anything  had to be done  it was always the elder who was forced to do it  but  if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late  or in the  night time  and the way led through the churchyard  or any other dismal  place  he answered  â  Oh  no father  Iâ  ll not go there  it makes me  shudder â   for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at  night which made the flesh creep  the listeners sometimes said  â  Oh   it makes us shudder â   The younger sat in a corner and listened with  the rest of them  and could not imagine what they could mean. â  They are  always saying  â  It makes me shudder  it makes me shudder â   It does not  make me shudder â   thought he. â  That  too  must be an art of which I  understand nothing â      Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day  â  Hearken to me   you fellow in the corner there  you are growing tall and strong  and you  too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your  brother works  but you do not even earn your salt.â   â  Well  father â   he  replied  â  I am quite willing to learn something  indeed  if it could but  be managed  I should like to learn how to shudder. I donâ  t understand  that at all yet.â   The elder brother smiled when he heard that  and  thought to himself  â  Goodness  what a blockhead that brother of mine is   He will never be good for anything as long as he lives  He who wants to  be a sickle must bend himself betimes.â      The father sighed  and answered him  â  You shall soon learn what it is to  shudder  but you will not earn your bread by that.â      Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit  and the father  bewailed his trouble  and told him how his younger son was so backward  in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. â  Just think â    said he  â  when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread  he  actually wanted to learn to shudder.â   â  If that be all â   replied the  sexton  â  he can learn that with me. Send him to me  and I will soon  polish him.â   The father was glad to do it  for he thought  â  It will  train the boy a little.â   The sexton therefore took him into his house   and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two  the sexton awoke  him at midnight  and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and  ring the bell. â  You shall soon learn what shuddering is â   thought he   and secretly went there before him  and when the boy was at the top of  the tower and turned round  and was just going to take hold of the bell  rope  he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding  hole. â  Who is there â   cried he  but the figure made no reply  and did  not move or stir. â  Give an answer â   cried the boy  â  or take yourself  off  you have no business here at night.â      The sexton  however  remained standing motionless that the boy might  think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time  â  What do you want  here   speak if you are an honest fellow  or I will throw you down the  steps â   The sexton thought  â  He canâ  t mean to be as bad as his words â    uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy  called to him for the third time  and as that was also to no purpose   he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs  so that it fell  down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he  rang the bell  went home  and without saying a word went to bed  and  fell asleep. The sextonâ  s wife waited a long time for her husband  but  he did not come back. At length she became uneasy  and wakened the boy   and asked  â  Do you know where my husband is  He climbed up the tower  before you did.â   â  No  I donâ  t know â   replied the boy  â  but someone was  standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps  and as he  would neither give an answer nor go away  I took him for a scoundrel   and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.  I should be sorry if it were.â   The woman ran away and found her husband   who was lying moaning in the corner  and had broken his leg.    She carried him down  and then with loud screams she hastened to the  boyâ  s father  â  Your boy â   cried she  â  has been the cause of a great  misfortune  He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his  leg. Take the good for nothing fellow out of our house.â   The father was  terrified  and ran thither and scolded the boy. â  What wicked tricks  are these â   said he. â  The devil must have put them into your head.â    â  Father â   he replied  â  do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was  standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know  who it was  and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go  away.â   â  Ah â   said the father  â  I have nothing but unhappiness with you.  Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.â      â  Yes  father  right willingly  wait only until it is day. Then will I  go forth and learn how to shudder  and then I shall  at any rate   understand one art which will support me.â   â  Learn what you will â   spoke  the father  â  it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.  Take these and go into the wide world  and tell no one from whence you  come  and who is your father  for I have reason to be ashamed of you.â    â  Yes  father  it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than  that  I can easily keep it in mind.â      When the day dawned  therefore  the boy put his fifty talers into his  pocket  and went forth on the great highway  and continually said to  himself  â  If I could but shudder  If I could but shudder â   Then a man  approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with  himself  and when they had walked a little farther to where they could  see the gallows  the man said to him  â  Look  there is the tree where  seven men have married the ropemakerâ  s daughter  and are now learning  how to fly. Sit down beneath it  and wait till night comes  and you will  soon learn how to shudder.â   â  If that is all that is wanted â   answered  the youth  â  it is easily done  but if I learn how to shudder as fast as  that  you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the  morning.â   Then the youth went to the gallows  sat down beneath it  and  waited till evening came. And as he was cold  he lighted himself a fire   but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire  he  could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each  other  and they moved backwards and forwards  he thought to himself   â  If you shiver below by the fire  how those up above must freeze and  suffer â   And as he felt pity for them  he raised the ladder  and climbed  up  unbound one of them after the other  and brought down all seven.  Then he stoked the fire  blew it  and set them all round it to warm  themselves. But they sat there and did not stir  and the fire caught  their clothes. So he said  â  Take care  or I will hang you up again.â   The  dead men  however  did not hear  but were quite silent  and let their  rags go on burning. At this he grew angry  and said  â  If you will not  take care  I cannot help you  I will not be burnt with you â   and he hung  them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell  asleep  and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have  the fifty talers  and said  â  Well do you know how to shudder â   â  No â    answered he  â  how should I know  Those fellows up there did not open  their mouths  and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which  they had on their bodies get burnt.â   Then the man saw that he would not  get the fifty talers that day  and went away saying  â  Such a youth has  never come my way before.â      The youth likewise went his way  and once more began to mutter to  himself  â  Ah  if I could but shudder  Ah  if I could but shudder â   A  waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked  â  Who are  you â   â  I donâ  t know â   answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked  â  From  whence do you come â   â  I know not.â   â  Who is your father â   â  That I may  not tell you.â   â  What is it that you are always muttering between your  teeth â   â  Ah â   replied the youth  â  I do so wish I could shudder  but  no one can teach me how.â   â  Enough of your foolish chatter â   said the  waggoner. â  Come  go with me  I will see about a place for you.â   The  youth went with the waggoner  and in the evening they arrived at an inn  where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour  the youth again said quite loudly  â  If I could but shudder  If I could  but shudder â   The host who heard this  laughed and said  â  If that is  your desire  there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.â   â  Ah   be silent â   said the hostess  â  so many prying persons have already lost  their lives  it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as  these should never see the daylight again.â      But the youth said  â  However difficult it may be  I will learn it. For  this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.â   He let the host have  no rest  until the latter told him  that not far from thence stood a  haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was   if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that  he who would venture should have his daughter to wife  and she was the  most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great  treasures  which were guarded by evil spirits  and these treasures would  then be freed  and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men  had gone into the castle  but as yet none had come out again. Then the  youth went next morning to the king  and said  â  If it be allowed  I will  willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.â      The king looked at him  and as the youth pleased him  he said  â  You may  ask for three things to take into the castle with you  but they must  be things without life.â   Then he answered  â  Then I ask for a fire  a  turning lathe  and a cutting board with the knife.â      The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the  day. When night was drawing near  the youth went up and made himself  a bright fire in one of the rooms  placed the cutting board and knife  beside it  and seated himself by the turning lathe. â  Ah  if I could  but shudder â   said he  â  but I shall not learn it here either.â   Towards  midnight he was about to poke his fire  and as he was blowing it   something cried suddenly from one corner  â  Au  miau  how cold we are â    â  You fools â   cried he  â  what are you crying about  If you are cold  come  and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.â   And when he had said  that  two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down  on each side of him  and looked savagely at him with their fiery  eyes. After a short time  when they had warmed themselves  they said   â  Comrade  shall we have a game of cards â   â  Why not â   he replied  â  but  just show me your paws.â   Then they stretched out their claws. â  Oh â   said  he  â  what long nails you have  Wait  I must first cut them for you.â    Thereupon he seized them by the throats  put them on the cutting board  and screwed their feet fast. â  I have looked at your fingers â   said he   â  and my fancy for card playing has gone â   and he struck them dead and  threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two   and was about to sit down again by his fire  out from every hole and  corner came black cats and black dogs with red hot chains  and more  and more of them came until he could no longer move  and they yelled  horribly  and got on his fire  pulled it to pieces  and tried to put  it out. He watched them for a while quietly  but at last when they were  going too far  he seized his cutting knife  and cried  â  Away with you   vermin â   and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away  the others  he killed  and threw out into the fish pond. When he came back he fanned  the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat  his  eyes would keep open no longer  and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he  looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. â  That is the very thing  for me â   said he  and got into it. When he was just going to shut his  eyes  however  the bed began to move of its own accord  and went over  the whole of the castle. â  Thatâ  s right â   said he  â  but go faster.â   Then  the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it  up and down   over thresholds and stairs  but suddenly hop  hop  it turned over upside  down  and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up  in the air  got out and said  â  Now anyone who likes  may drive â   and  lay down by his fire  and slept till it was day. In the morning the king  came  and when he saw him lying there on the ground  he thought the evil  spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he  â  After all it is a  pity   for so handsome a man.â   The youth heard it  got up  and said  â  It  has not come to that yet.â   Then the king was astonished  but very glad   and asked how he had fared. â  Very well indeed â   answered he  â  one  night is past  the two others will pass likewise.â   Then he went to the  innkeeper  who opened his eyes very wide  and said  â  I never expected to  see you alive again  Have you learnt how to shudder yet â   â  No â   said he   â  it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me â      The second night he again went up into the old castle  sat down by the  fire  and once more began his old song  â  If I could but shudder â   When  midnight came  an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard  at  first it was low  but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for  a while  and at length with a loud scream  half a man came down the  chimney and fell before him. â  Hullo â   cried he  â  another half belongs  to this. This is not enough â   Then the uproar began again  there was a  roaring and howling  and the other half fell down likewise. â  Wait â   said  he  â  I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.â   When he had done  that and looked round again  the two pieces were joined together  and a  hideous man was sitting in his place. â  That is no part of our bargain â    said the youth  â  the bench is mine.â   The man wanted to push him away   the youth  however  would not allow that  but thrust him off with all  his strength  and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more  men fell down  one after the other  they brought nine dead menâ  s legs  and two skulls  and set them up and played at nine pins with them. The  youth also wanted to play and said  â  Listen you  can I join you â   â  Yes   if you have any money.â   â  Money enough â   replied he  â  but your balls are  not quite round.â   Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and  turned them till they were round. â  There  now they will roll better â    said he. â  Hurrah  now weâ  ll have fun â   He played with them and lost some  of his money  but when it struck twelve  everything vanished from his  sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came  to inquire after him. â  How has it fared with you this time â   asked he.  â  I have been playing at nine pins â   he answered  â  and have lost a couple  of farthings.â   â  Have you not shuddered then â   â  What â   said he  â  I have  had a wonderful time  If I did but know what it was to shudder â      The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly   â  If I could but shudder.â   When it grew late  six tall men came in and  brought a coffin. Then he said  â  Ha  ha  that is certainly my little  cousin  who died only a few days ago â   and he beckoned with his finger   and cried  â  Come  little cousin  come.â   They placed the coffin on the  ground  but he went to it and took the lid off  and a dead man lay  therein. He felt his face  but it was cold as ice. â  Wait â   said he  â  I  will warm you a little â   and went to the fire and warmed his hand and  laid it on the dead manâ  s face  but he remained cold. Then he took him  out  and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his  arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good  he  thought to himself  â  When two people lie in bed together  they warm each  other â   and carried him to the bed  covered him over and lay down by  him. After a short time the dead man became warm too  and began to move.  Then said the youth  â  See  little cousin  have I not warmed you â   The  dead man  however  got up and cried  â  Now will I strangle you.â      â  What â   said he  â  is that the way you thank me  You shall at once go  into your coffin again â   and he took him up  threw him into it  and shut  the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. â  I cannot  manage to shudder â   said he. â  I shall never learn it here as long as I  live.â      Then a man entered who was taller than all others  and looked terrible.  He was old  however  and had a long white beard. â  You wretch â   cried he   â  you shall soon learn what it is to shudder  for you shall die.â   â  Not so  fast â   replied the youth. â  If I am to die  I shall have to have a say  in it.â   â  I will soon seize you â   said the fiend. â  Softly  softly  do not  talk so big. I am as strong as you are  and perhaps even stronger.â    â  We shall see â   said the old man. â  If you are stronger  I will let you  go  come  we will try.â   Then he led him by dark passages to a smithâ  s  forge  took an axe  and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.  â  I can do better than that â   said the youth  and went to the other  anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on  and his  white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe  split the anvil  with one blow  and in it caught the old manâ  s beard. â  Now I have you â    said the youth. â  Now it is your turn to die.â   Then he seized an iron bar  and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop  when he  would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.  The old man led him back into the castle  and in a cellar showed him  three chests full of gold. â  Of these â   said he  â  one part is for the  poor  the other for the king  the third yours.â   In the meantime it  struck twelve  and the spirit disappeared  so that the youth stood in  darkness. â  I shall still be able to find my way out â   said he  and felt  about  found the way into the room  and slept there by his fire.  Next morning the king came and said  â  Now you must have learnt what  shuddering is â   â  No â   he answered  â  what can it be  My dead cousin was  here  and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down  below  but no one told me what it was to shudder.â   â  Then â   said the  king  â  you have saved the castle  and shall marry my daughter.â   â  That  is all very well â   said he  â  but still I do not know what it is to  shudder â      Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated  but howsoever  much the young king loved his wife  and however happy he was  he still  said always  â  If I could but shudder  if I could but shudder.â   And this  at last angered her. Her waiting maid said  â  I will find a cure for him   he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.â   She went out to the stream  which flowed through the garden  and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons  brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping  his wife was  to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water  with the gudgeons in it over him  so that the little fishes would  sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried  â  Oh  what makes me shudder  so   what makes me shudder so  dear wife  Ah  now I know what it is to  shudder â            KING GRISLY BEARD      A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very  beautiful  but so proud  and haughty  and conceited  that none of the  princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her  and she  only made sport of them.    Once upon a time the king held a great feast  and asked thither all  her suitors  and they all sat in a row  ranged according to their  rank  kings  and princes  and dukes  and earls  and counts  and barons   and knights. Then the princess came in  and as she passed by them she  had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat  â  Heâ  s  as round as a tub â   said she. The next was too tall  â  What a maypole â    said she. The next was too short  â  What a dumpling â   said she. The  fourth was too pale  and she called him â  Wallface.â   The fifth was too  red  so she called him â  Coxcomb.â   The sixth was not straight enough   so she said he was like a green stick  that had been laid to dry over  a bakerâ  s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one  but  she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. â  Look at  him â   said she  â  his beard is like an old mop  he shall be called  Grisly beard.â   So the king got the nickname of Grisly beard.    But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved   and how she ill treated all his guests  and he vowed that  willing or  unwilling  she should marry the first man  be he prince or beggar  that  came to the door.    Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler  who began to play  under the window and beg alms  and when the king heard him  he said   â  Let him come in.â   So they brought in a dirty looking fellow  and when  he had sung before the king and the princess  he begged a boon. Then the  king said  â  You have sung so well  that I will give you my daughter for  your wife.â   The princess begged and prayed  but the king said  â  I have  sworn to give you to the first comer  and I will keep my word.â   So words  and tears were of no avail  the parson was sent for  and she was married  to the fiddler. When this was over the king said  â  Now get ready to  go  you must not stay here  you must travel on with your husband.â      Then the fiddler went his way  and took her with him  and they soon came  to a great wood. â  Pray â   said she  â  whose is this wood â   â  It belongs  to King Grisly beard â   answered he  â  hadst thou taken him  all had been  thine.â   â  Ah  unlucky wretch that I am â   sighed she  â  would that I had  married King Grisly beard â   Next they came to some fine meadows. â  Whose  are these beautiful green meadows â   said she. â  They belong to King  Grisly beard  hadst thou taken him  they had all been thine.â   â  Ah   unlucky wretch that I am â   said she  â  would that I had married King  Grisly beard â      Then they came to a great city. â  Whose is this noble city â   said she.  â  It belongs to King Grisly beard  hadst thou taken him  it had all been  thine.â   â  Ah  wretch that I am â   sighed she  â  why did I not marry King  Grisly beard â   â  That is no business of mine â   said the fiddler  â  why  should you wish for another husband  Am not I good enough for you â      At last they came to a small cottage. â  What a paltry place â   said she   â  to whom does that little dirty hole belong â   Then the fiddler said   â  That is your and my house  where we are to live.â   â  Where are your  servants â   cried she. â  What do we want with servants â   said he  â  you  must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire  and put  on water and cook my supper  for I am very tired.â   But the princess knew  nothing of making fires and cooking  and the fiddler was forced to help  her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed  but the  fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus  they lived for two days  and when they had eaten up all there was in the  cottage  the man said  â  Wife  we canâ  t go on thus  spending money and  earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.â   Then he went out and  cut willows  and brought them home  and she began to weave  but it made  her fingers very sore. â  I see this work wonâ  t do â   said he  â  try and  spin  perhaps you will do that better.â   So she sat down and tried to  spin  but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. â  See  now â   said the fiddler  â  you are good for nothing  you can do no work   what a bargain I have got  However  Iâ  ll try and set up a trade in pots  and pans  and you shall stand in the market and sell them.â   â  Alas â    sighed she  â  if any of my fatherâ  s court should pass by and see me  standing in the market  how they will laugh at me â      But her husband did not care for that  and said she must work  if she  did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well  for many  people  seeing such a beautiful woman  went to buy her wares  and paid  their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on  this as long as it lasted  and then her husband bought a fresh lot of  ware  and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market  but  a drunken soldier soon came by  and rode his horse against her stall   and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry   and knew not what to do. â  Ah  what will become of me â   said she  â  what  will my husband say â   So she ran home and told him all. â  Who would  have thought you would have been so silly â   said he  â  as to put an  earthenware stall in the corner of the market  where everybody passes   but let us have no more crying  I see you are not fit for this sort of  work  so I have been to the kingâ  s palace  and asked if they did not  want a kitchen maid  and they say they will take you  and there you will  have plenty to eat.â      Thus the princess became a kitchen maid  and helped the cook to do all  the dirtiest work  but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat  that was left  and on this they lived.    She had not been there long before she heard that the kingâ  s eldest son  was passing by  going to be married  and she went to one of the windows  and looked out. Everything was ready  and all the pomp and brightness of  the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly  which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich  meats  which she put into her basket to take home.    All on a sudden  as she was going out  in came the kingâ  s son in golden  clothes  and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door  he took her  by the hand  and said she should be his partner in the dance  but she  trembled for fear  for she saw that it was King Grisly beard  who was  making sport of her. However  he kept fast hold  and led her in  and the  cover of the basket came off  so that the meats in it fell about. Then  everybody laughed and jeered at her  and she was so abashed  that she  wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the  door to run away  but on the steps King Grisly beard overtook her  and  brought her back and said  â  Fear me not  I am the fiddler who has lived  with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I  am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only  to cure you of your silly pride  and to show you the folly of your  ill treatment of me. Now all is over  you have learnt wisdom  and it is  time to hold our marriage feast.â      Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes  and  her father and his whole court were there already  and welcomed her home  on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was  grand  they danced and sang  all were merry  and I only wish that you  and I had been of the party.          IRON HANS      There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his  palace  full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a  huntsman to shoot him a roe  but he did not come back. â  Perhaps some  accident has befallen him â   said the king  and the next day he sent out  two more huntsmen who were to search for him  but they too stayed away.  Then on the third day  he sent for all his huntsmen  and said  â  Scour  the whole forest through  and do not give up until you have found all  three.â   But of these also  none came home again  none were seen again.  From that time forth  no one would any longer venture into the forest   and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude  and nothing was seen  of it  but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for  many years  when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as  seeking a situation  and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The  king  however  would not give his consent  and said  â  It is not safe in  there  I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others   and you would never come out again.â   The huntsman replied  â  Lord  I will  venture it at my own risk  of fear I know nothing.â      The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was  not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way  and wanted to  pursue it  but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a  deep pool  could go no farther  and a naked arm stretched itself out of  the water  seized it  and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that  he  went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the  water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body  was brown like rusty iron  and whose hair hung over his face down to his  knees. They bound him with cords  and led him away to the castle. There  was great astonishment over the wild man  the king  however  had him put  in an iron cage in his courtyard  and forbade the door to be opened  on pain of death  and the queen herself was to take the key into her  keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the  forest with safety.    The king had a son of eight years  who was once playing in the  courtyard  and while he was playing  his golden ball fell into the cage.  The boy ran thither and said  â  Give me my ball out.â   â  Not till you have  opened the door for me â   answered the man. â  No â   said the boy  â  I will  not do that  the king has forbidden it â   and ran away. The next day he  again went and asked for his ball  the wild man said  â  Open my door â    but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting   and the boy went once more and said  â  I cannot open the door even if I  wished  for I have not the key.â   Then the wild man said  â  It lies under  your motherâ  s pillow  you can get it there.â   The boy  who wanted to have  his ball back  cast all thought to the winds  and brought the key. The  door opened with difficulty  and the boy pinched his fingers. When it  was open the wild man stepped out  gave him the golden ball  and hurried  away. The boy had become afraid  he called and cried after him  â  Oh   wild man  do not go away  or I shall be beaten â   The wild man turned  back  took him up  set him on his shoulder  and went with hasty steps  into the forest. When the king came home  he observed the empty cage   and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it   and sought the key  but it was gone. She called the boy  but no one  answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields  but  they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened  and  much grief reigned in the royal court.    When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest  he took the boy  down from his shoulder  and said to him  â  You will never see your father  and mother again  but I will keep you with me  for you have set me free   and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you  you shall fare  well. Of treasure and gold have I enough  and more than anyone in the  world.â   He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept  and the  next morning the man took him to a well  and said  â  Behold  the gold  well is as bright and clear as crystal  you shall sit beside it  and  take care that nothing falls into it  or it will be polluted. I will  come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.â   The boy placed  himself by the brink of the well  and often saw a golden fish or a  golden snake show itself therein  and took care that nothing fell in.  As he was thus sitting  his finger hurt him so violently that he  involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again  but saw  that it was quite gilded  and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold  off again  all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back   looked at the boy  and said  â  What has happened to the well â   â  Nothing  nothing â   he answered  and held his finger behind his back  that the  man might not see it. But he said  â  You have dipped your finger into  the water  this time it may pass  but take care you do not again let  anything go in.â   By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and  watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head   and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly  out  but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came  and already knew  what had happened. â  You have let a hair fall into the well â   said he.  â  I will allow you to watch by it once more  but if this happens for the  third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with  me.â      On the third day  the boy sat by the well  and did not stir his finger   however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him  and he looked at  the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he  still bent down more and more while he was doing so  and trying to look  straight into the eyes  his long hair fell down from his shoulders into  the water. He raised himself up quickly  but the whole of the hair of  his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how  terrified the poor boy was  He took his pocket handkerchief and tied it  round his head  in order that the man might not see it. When he came he  already knew everything  and said  â  Take the handkerchief off.â   Then the  golden hair streamed forth  and let the boy excuse himself as he might   it was of no use. â  You have not stood the trial and can stay here no  longer. Go forth into the world  there you will learn what poverty is.  But as you have not a bad heart  and as I mean well by you  there is  one thing I will grant you  if you fall into any difficulty  come to the  forest and cry  â  Iron Hans â   and then I will come and help you. My  power is great  greater than you think  and I have gold and silver in  abundance.â      Then the kingâ  s son left the forest  and walked by beaten and unbeaten  paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he  looked for work  but could find none  and he learnt nothing by which he  could help himself. At length he went to the palace  and asked if they  would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use  they could make of him  but they liked him  and told him to stay. At  length the cook took him into his service  and said he might carry wood  and water  and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that  no one else was at hand  the cook ordered him to carry the food to the  royal table  but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen  he  kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under  the kingâ  s notice  and he said  â  When you come to the royal table you  must take your hat off.â   He answered  â  Ah  Lord  I cannot  I have a bad  sore place on my head.â   Then the king had the cook called before him  and scolded him  and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his  service  and that he was to send him away at once. The cook  however   had pity on him  and exchanged him for the gardenerâ  s boy.    And now the boy had to plant and water the garden  hoe and dig  and bear  the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in  the garden  the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air  might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so  that the rays fell into the bedroom of the kingâ  s daughter  and up she  sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy  and cried to  him  â  Boy  bring me a wreath of flowers.â   He put his cap on with all  haste  and gathered wild field flowers and bound them together. When he  was ascending the stairs with them  the gardener met him  and said  â  How  can you take the kingâ  s daughter a garland of such common flowers  Go  quickly  and get another  and seek out the prettiest and rarest.â   â  Oh   no â   replied the boy  â  the wild ones have more scent  and will please  her better.â   When he got into the room  the kingâ  s daughter said  â  Take  your cap off  it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.â   He again  said  â  I may not  I have a sore head.â   She  however  caught at his  cap and pulled it off  and then his golden hair rolled down on his  shoulders  and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out  but she  held him by the arm  and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he  departed  but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the  gardener  and said  â  I present them to your children  they can play with  them.â   The following day the kingâ  s daughter again called to him that he  was to bring her a wreath of field flowers  and then he went in with it   she instantly snatched at his cap  and wanted to take it away from him   but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of  ducats  but he would not keep them  and gave them to the gardener for  playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the  same  she could not get his cap away from him  and he would not have her  money.    Not long afterwards  the country was overrun by war. The king gathered  together his people  and did not know whether or not he could offer any  opposition to the enemy  who was superior in strength and had a mighty  army. Then said the gardenerâ  s boy  â  I am grown up  and will go to the  wars also  only give me a horse.â   The others laughed  and said  â  Seek  one for yourself when we are gone  we will leave one behind us in the  stable for you.â   When they had gone forth  he went into the stable  and  led the horse out  it was lame of one foot  and limped hobblety jib   hobblety jib  nevertheless he mounted it  and rode away to the dark  forest. When he came to the outskirts  he called â  Iron Hansâ   three  times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man  appeared immediately  and said  â  What do you desire â   â  I want a strong  steed  for I am going to the wars.â   â  That you shall have  and still more  than you ask for.â   Then the wild man went back into the forest  and it  was not long before a stable boy came out of it  who led a horse that  snorted with its nostrils  and could hardly be restrained  and behind  them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron  and  their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three legged  horse to the stable boy  mounted the other  and rode at the head of the  soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the kingâ  s  men had already fallen  and little was wanting to make the rest give  way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers  broke like  a hurricane over the enemy  and beat down all who opposed him. They  began to flee  but the youth pursued  and never stopped  until there  was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king  however  he  conducted his troop by byways back to the forest  and called forth Iron  Hans. â  What do you desire â   asked the wild man. â  Take back your horse  and your troops  and give me my three legged horse again.â   All that he  asked was done  and soon he was riding on his three legged horse. When  the king returned to his palace  his daughter went to meet him  and  wished him joy of his victory. â  I am not the one who carried away the  victory â   said he  â  but a strange knight who came to my assistance with  his soldiers.â   The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was   but the king did not know  and said  â  He followed the enemy  and I did  not see him again.â   She inquired of the gardener where his boy was  but  he smiled  and said  â  He has just come home on his three legged horse   and the others have been mocking him  and crying  â  Here comes our  hobblety jib back again â   They asked  too  â  Under what hedge have you  been lying sleeping all the time â   So he said  â  I did the best of all   and it would have gone badly without me.â   And then he was still more  ridiculed.â      The king said to his daughter  â  I will proclaim a great feast that shall  last for three days  and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the  unknown man will show himself.â   When the feast was announced  the youth  went out to the forest  and called Iron Hans. â  What do you desire â    asked he. â  That I may catch the kingâ  s daughterâ  s golden apple.â   â  It is  as safe as if you had it already â   said Iron Hans. â  You shall likewise  have a suit of red armour for the occasion  and ride on a spirited  chestnut horse.â   When the day came  the youth galloped to the spot  took  his place amongst the knights  and was recognized by no one. The kingâ  s  daughter came forward  and threw a golden apple to the knights  but none  of them caught it but he  only as soon as he had it he galloped away.    On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight  and gave him  a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple  and  he did not linger an instant  but galloped off with it. The king grew  angry  and said  â  That is not allowed  he must appear before me and tell  his name.â   He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple   should go away again they should pursue him  and if he would not come  back willingly  they were to cut him down and stab him.    On the third day  he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and  a black horse  and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off  with it  the kingâ  s attendants pursued him  and one of them got so near  him that he wounded the youthâ  s leg with the point of his sword. The  youth nevertheless escaped from them  but his horse leapt so violently  that the helmet fell from the youthâ  s head  and they could see that he  had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.    The following day the kingâ  s daughter asked the gardener about his  boy. â  He is at work in the garden  the queer creature has been at the  festival too  and only came home yesterday evening  he has likewise  shown my children three golden apples which he has won.â      The king had him summoned into his presence  and he came and again had  his little cap on his head. But the kingâ  s daughter went up to him and  took it off  and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders  and  he was so handsome that all were amazed. â  Are you the knight who came  every day to the festival  always in different colours  and who caught  the three golden apples â   asked the king. â  Yes â   answered he  â  and here  the apples are â   and he took them out of his pocket  and returned them  to the king. â  If you desire further proof  you may see the wound which  your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight  who helped you to your victory over your enemies.â   â  If you can perform  such deeds as that  you are no gardenerâ  s boy  tell me  who is your  father â   â  My father is a mighty king  and gold have I in plenty as great  as I require.â   â  I well see â   said the king  â  that I owe my thanks to  you  can I do anything to please you â   â  Yes â   answered he  â  that indeed  you can. Give me your daughter to wife.â   The maiden laughed  and said   â  He does not stand much on ceremony  but I have already seen by his  golden hair that he was no gardenerâ  s boy â   and then she went and  kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding  and were in great  delight  for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear  son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage feast  the music  suddenly stopped  the doors opened  and a stately king came in with a  great retinue. He went up to the youth  embraced him and said  â  I am  Iron Hans  and was by enchantment a wild man  but you have set me free   all the treasures which I possess  shall be your property.â            CAT SKIN      There was once a king  whose queen had hair of the purest gold  and was  so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of  the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill  and when she felt that her  end drew near she called the king to her and said  â  Promise me that you  will never marry again  unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful  as I am  and who has golden hair like mine.â   Then when the king in his  grief promised all she asked  she shut her eyes and died. But the king  was not to be comforted  and for a long time never thought of taking  another wife. At last  however  his wise men said  â  this will not do   the king must marry again  that we may have a queen.â   So messengers were  sent far and wide  to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.  But there was no princess in the world so beautiful  and if there had  been  still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the  messengers came home  and had had all their trouble for nothing.    Now the king had a daughter  who was just as beautiful as her mother   and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up  the king looked  at her and saw that she was just like this late queen  then he said to  his courtiers  â  May I not marry my daughter  She is the very image of my  dead wife  unless I have her  I shall not find any bride upon the whole  earth  and you say there must be a queen.â   When the courtiers heard this  they were shocked  and said  â  Heaven forbid that a father should marry  his daughter  Out of so great a sin no good can come.â   And his daughter  was also shocked  but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts   so she said to him  â  Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses   one must be of gold  like the sun  another must be of shining silver   like the moon  and a third must be dazzling as the stars  besides this   I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together  to  which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.â   And thus  she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the  most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses  one golden   like the sun  another silvery  like the moon  and a third sparkling   like the stars  and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in  his kingdom  and to take the finest fur out of their skins  and thus a  mantle of a thousand furs was made.    When all were ready  the king sent them to her  but she got up in the  night when all were asleep  and took three of her trinkets  a golden  ring  a golden necklace  and a golden brooch  and packed the three  dresses  of the sun  the moon  and the stars  up in a nutshell  and  wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur  and besmeared  her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for  help in her need  and went away  and journeyed on the whole night  till  at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired  she sat herself  down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep  and there she slept  on till it was midday.    Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it  his dogs  came to the tree  and began to snuff about  and run round and round  and  bark. â  Look sharp â   said the king to the huntsmen  â  and see what sort  of game lies there.â   And the huntsmen went up to the tree  and when they  came back again said  â  In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful  beast  such as we never saw before  its skin seems to be of a thousand  kinds of fur  but there it lies fast asleep.â   â  See â   said the king  â  if  you can catch it alive  and we will take it with us.â   So the huntsmen  took it up  and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened  and said   â  I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left  have pity on  me and take me with you.â   Then they said  â  Yes  Miss Cat skin  you will  do for the kitchen  you can sweep up the ashes  and do things of that  sort.â   So they put her into the coach  and took her home to the kingâ  s  palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase  where  no light of day ever peeped in  and said  â  Cat skin  you may lie and  sleep there.â   And she was sent into the kitchen  and made to fetch wood  and water  to blow the fire  pluck the poultry  pick the herbs  sift the  ashes  and do all the dirty work.    Thus Cat skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. â  Ah  pretty  princess â   thought she  â  what will now become of thee â   But it happened  one day that a feast was to be held in the kingâ  s castle  so she said to  the cook  â  May I go up a little while and see what is going on  I will  take care and stand behind the door.â   And the cook said  â  Yes  you may  go  but be back again in half an hourâ  s time  to rake out the ashes.â    Then she took her little lamp  and went into her cabin  and took off the  fur skin  and washed the soot from off her face and hands  so that her  beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened  her nutshell  and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun   and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her  for nobody knew  her  and they thought she could be no less than a kingâ  s daughter. But  the king came up to her  and held out his hand and danced with her  and  he thought in his heart  â  I never saw any one half so beautiful.â      When the dance was at an end she curtsied  and when the king looked  round for her  she was gone  no one knew wither. The guards that stood  at the castle gate were called in  but they had seen no one. The truth  was  that she had run into her little cabin  pulled off her dress   blackened her face and hands  put on the fur skin cloak  and was  Cat skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work  and began  to rake the ashes  the cook said  â  Let that alone till the morning  and  heat the kingâ  s soup  I should like to run up now and give a peep  but  take care you donâ  t let a hair fall into it  or you will run a chance of  never eating again.â      As soon as the cook went away  Cat skin heated the kingâ  s soup  and  toasted a slice of bread first  as nicely as ever she could  and when it  was ready  she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring   and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over   the king ordered his soup to be brought in  and it pleased him so well   that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom  he saw a gold ring lying  and as he could not make out how it had got  there  he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when  he heard the order  and said to Cat skin  â  You must have let a hair fall  into the soup  if it be so  you will have a good beating.â   Then he went  before the king  and he asked him who had cooked the soup. â  I did â    answered the cook. But the king said  â  That is not true  it was better  done than you could do it.â   Then he answered  â  To tell the truth I did  not cook it  but Cat skin did.â   â  Then let Cat skin come up â   said the  king  and when she came he said to her  â  Who are you â   â  I am a poor  child â   said she  â  that has lost both father and mother.â   â  How came you  in my palace â   asked he. â  I am good for nothing â   said she  â  but to be  scullion girl  and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.â   â  But how  did you get the ring that was in the soup â   asked the king. Then she  would not own that she knew anything about the ring  so the king sent  her away again about her business.    After a time there was another feast  and Cat skin asked the cook to let  her go up and see it as before. â  Yes â   said he  â  but come again in half  an hour  and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.â   Then she  ran to her little cabin  washed herself quickly  and took her dress  out which was silvery as the moon  and put it on  and when she went in   looking like a kingâ  s daughter  the king went up to her  and rejoiced at  seeing her again  and when the dance began he danced with her. After the  dance was at an end she managed to slip out  so slyly that the king did  not see where she was gone  but she sprang into her little cabin  and  made herself into Cat skin again  and went into the kitchen to cook the  soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs  she got the golden necklace and  dropped it into the soup  then it was brought to the king  who ate it   and it pleased him as well as before  so he sent for the cook  who  was again forced to tell him that Cat skin had cooked it. Cat skin was  brought again before the king  but she still told him that she was only  fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.    But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third  time  it happened just the same as before. â  You must be a witch   Cat skin â   said the cook  â  for you always put something into your soup   so that it pleases the king better than mine.â   However  he let her go up  as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars  and  went into the ball room in it  and the king danced with her again  and  thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst  he was dancing with her  he put a gold ring on her finger without her  seeing it  and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.  When it was at an end  he would have held her fast by the hand  but she  slipped away  and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight  of her  and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under  the stairs. But this time she kept away too long  and stayed beyond the  half hour  so she had not time to take off her fine dress  and threw her  fur mantle over it  and in her haste did not blacken herself all over  with soot  but left one of her fingers white.    Then she ran into the kitchen  and cooked the kingâ  s soup  and as soon  as the cook was gone  she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the  king got to the bottom  he ordered Cat skin to be called once more  and  soon saw the white finger  and the ring that he had put on it whilst  they were dancing  so he seized her hand  and kept fast hold of it  and  when she wanted to loose herself and spring away  the fur cloak fell off  a little on one side  and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.    Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off  and her golden hair and  beautiful form were seen  and she could no longer hide herself  so she  washed the soot and ashes from her face  and showed herself to be the  most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said   â  You are my beloved bride  and we will never more be parted from each  other.â   And the wedding feast was held  and a merry day it was  as ever  was heard of or seen in that country  or indeed in any other.          SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED      There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of  the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose trees  one of which bore  white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the  two rose trees  and one was called Snow white  and the other Rose red.  They were as good and happy  as busy and cheerful as ever two children  in the world were  only Snow white was more quiet and gentle than  Rose red. Rose red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields  seeking flowers and catching butterflies  but Snow white sat at home  with her mother  and helped her with her housework  or read to her when  there was nothing to do.    The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each  other by the hand when they went out together  and when Snow white said   â  We will not leave each other â   Rose red answered  â  Never so long as we  live â   and their mother would add  â  What one has she must share with the  other.â      They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries  and no  beasts did them any harm  but came close to them trustfully. The little  hare would eat a cabbage leaf out of their hands  the roe grazed by  their side  the stag leapt merrily by them  and the birds sat still upon  the boughs  and sang whatever they knew.    No mishap overtook them  if they had stayed too late in the forest  and  night came on  they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss   and slept until morning came  and their mother knew this and did not  worry on their account.    Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused  them  they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near  their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them  but said nothing  and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that  they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice  and would certainly  have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces  further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who  watches over good children.    Snow white and Rose red kept their motherâ  s little cottage so neat that  it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose red took care  of the house  and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her motherâ  s  bed before she awoke  in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter  Snow white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle  was of brass and shone like gold  so brightly was it polished. In the  evening  when the snowflakes fell  the mother said  â  Go  Snow white  and  bolt the door â   and then they sat round the hearth  and the mother took  her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book  and the two girls  listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the  floor  and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head  hidden beneath its wings.    One evening  as they were thus sitting comfortably together  someone  knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said   â  Quick  Rose red  open the door  it must be a traveller who is seeking  shelter.â   Rose red went and pushed back the bolt  thinking that it was a  poor man  but it was not  it was a bear that stretched his broad  black  head within the door.    Rose red screamed and sprang back  the lamb bleated  the dove fluttered   and Snow white hid herself behind her motherâ  s bed. But the bear began  to speak and said  â  Do not be afraid  I will do you no harm  I am  half frozen  and only want to warm myself a little beside you.â      â  Poor bear â   said the mother  â  lie down by the fire  only take care that  you do not burn your coat.â   Then she cried  â  Snow white  Rose red  come  out  the bear will do you no harm  he means well.â   So they both came  out  and by and by the lamb and dove came nearer  and were not afraid  of him. The bear said  â  Here  children  knock the snow out of my coat a  littleâ    so they brought the broom and swept the bearâ  s hide clean   and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and  comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home  and played  tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands   put their feet upon his back and rolled him about  or they took a  hazel switch and beat him  and when he growled they laughed. But the  bear took it all in good part  only when they were too rough he called  out  â  Leave me alive  children       Snow white  Rose red     Will you beat your wooer dead â      When it was bed time  and the others went to bed  the mother said to the  bear  â  You can lie there by the hearth  and then you will be safe from  the cold and the bad weather.â   As soon as day dawned the two children  let him out  and he trotted across the snow into the forest.    Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time  laid himself  down by the hearth  and let the children amuse themselves with him as  much as they liked  and they got so used to him that the doors were  never fastened until their black friend had arrived.    When spring had come and all outside was green  the bear said one  morning to Snow white  â  Now I must go away  and cannot come back for the  whole summer.â   â  Where are you going  then  dear bear â   asked Snow white.  â  I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked  dwarfs. In the winter  when the earth is frozen hard  they are obliged  to stay below and cannot work their way through  but now  when the sun  has thawed and warmed the earth  they break through it  and come out to  pry and steal  and what once gets into their hands  and in their caves   does not easily see daylight again.â      Snow white was quite sorry at his departure  and as she unbolted the  door for him  and the bear was hurrying out  he caught against the bolt  and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off  and it seemed to Snow white  as if she had seen gold shining through it  but she was not sure about  it. The bear ran away quickly  and was soon out of sight behind the  trees.    A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest  to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the  ground  and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and  forwards in the grass  but they could not make out what it was. When  they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a  snow white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a  crevice of the tree  and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog  tied to a rope  and did not know what to do.    He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried  â  Why do you  stand there  Can you not come here and help me â   â  What are you up to   little man â   asked Rose red. â  You stupid  prying goose â   answered the  dwarf  â  I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.  The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with  heavy logs  we do not swallow so much as you coarse  greedy folk. I had  just driven the wedge safely in  and everything was going as I wished   but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out  and the  tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white  beard  so now it is tight and I cannot get away  and the silly  sleek   milk faced things laugh  Ugh  how odious you are â      The children tried very hard  but they could not pull the beard out  it  was caught too fast. â  I will run and fetch someone â   said Rose red. â  You  senseless goose â   snarled the dwarf  â  why should you fetch someone  You  are already two too many for me  can you not think of something better â    â  Donâ  t be impatient â   said Snow white  â  I will help you â   and she pulled  her scissors out of her pocket  and cut off the end of the beard.    As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay  amongst the roots of the tree  and which was full of gold  and lifted it  up  grumbling to himself  â  Uncouth people  to cut off a piece of my fine  beard. Bad luck to you â   and then he swung the bag upon his back  and  went off without even once looking at the children.    Some time afterwards Snow white and Rose red went to catch a dish  of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large  grasshopper jumping towards the water  as if it were going to leap in.  They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. â  Where are you going â   said  Rose red  â  you surely donâ  t want to go into the water â   â  I am not such  a fool â   cried the dwarf  â  donâ  t you see that the accursed fish wants  to pull me in â   The little man had been sitting there fishing  and  unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing line  a  moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not  strength to pull it out  the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the  dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes  but it was of  little good  for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish  and  was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.    The girls came just in time  they held him fast and tried to free his  beard from the line  but all in vain  beard and line were entangled fast  together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut  the beard  whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that  he screamed out  â  Is that civil  you toadstool  to disfigure a manâ  s  face  Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard  Now you have  cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.  I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes â   Then he took  out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes  and without another word  he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.    It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the  town to buy needles and thread  and laces and ribbons. The road led them  across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There  they noticed a large bird hovering in the air  flying slowly round and  round above them  it sank lower and lower  and at last settled near a  rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud  piteous cry. They ran  up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance  the dwarf  and was going to carry him off.    The children  full of pity  at once took tight hold of the little man   and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.  As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried  with his shrill voice  â  Could you not have done it more carefully  You  dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes  you  clumsy creatures â   Then he took up a sack full of precious stones  and  slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls  who by  this time were used to his ingratitude  went on their way and did their  business in town.    As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the  dwarf  who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot   and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening  sun shone upon the brilliant stones  they glittered and sparkled with  all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared  at them. â  Why do you stand gaping there â   cried the dwarf  and his  ashen grey face became copper red with rage. He was still cursing when a  loud growling was heard  and a black bear came trotting towards them out  of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright  but he could not reach  his cave  for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart  he cried  â  Dear Mr Bear  spare me  I will give you all my treasures   look  the beautiful jewels lying there  Grant me my life  what do you  want with such a slender little fellow as I  you would not feel me  between your teeth. Come  take these two wicked girls  they are tender  morsels for you  fat as young quails  for mercyâ  s sake eat them â   The  bear took no heed of his words  but gave the wicked creature a single  blow with his paw  and he did not move again.    The girls had run away  but the bear called to them  â  Snow white and  Rose red  do not be afraid  wait  I will come with you.â   Then they  recognized his voice and waited  and when he came up to them suddenly  his bearskin fell off  and he stood there a handsome man  clothed all in  gold. â  I am a kingâ  s son â   he said  â  and I was bewitched by that wicked  dwarf  who had stolen my treasures  I have had to run about the forest  as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his  well deserved punishment.    Snow white was married to him  and Rose red to his brother  and they  divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered  together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with  her children for many years. She took the two rose trees with her  and  they stood before her window  and every year bore the most beautiful  roses  white and red.'"
